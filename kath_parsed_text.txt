Lol you should come too. And bring your "friend" Ûæåµ
ok I'll come!
doesn't exist
no gf
And bring your gf.
never existed
that's about it
we hung out a lot
I wanted something more she wasn't sure if she wanted
just friends
haha well we were never together
What happened to
Did you tell her you have mad uber credits though?
we had fun but she doesn't feel a spark
D:
Oh what was it about?
she thinks it's not gonna work out
actually we had a talk
haha
On a more serious note, I'm sorry to hear that
Hahah
damnnn
that's where I went wrong
oh shit!!
so we're not gonna hang out for a while
it's hard cuz we hung out a lot and became pretty close friends
yaaa
Invite her - we can all hang out in a group and it won't be awk
üòï I feel like the distance makes it awkward
so it won't be awkward
we can but I'll need some time
so it's not just losing the possibility of dating her
Why can't y'all just be friends then?
I'll see how I feel then
maybbee
hmm
also I think I'll give her some space for a bit
cuz I didn't know she made her decision
and I think she felt a bit awkward for a while when we kept hanging out for a bit
I think once she made up her mind she didn't tell me immediately
time to meet new people haha
but it's ok
should be fun though!
hahah maybe I'll bring a friend
Ah. Well idk if you want to invite anyone else to the pier lol. It's just Calvin and I - idk if you feel weird about that. But if not - yeah join us üòä

the random party I was talking about yesterday
typing is hard
reckless drinking is the only type of drinking
haha!
Ohhh. Maybe. I'm still feeling the consequences of my reckless drinking last night unfortunately.
LOL
I feel like I'm very obnoxious as a drunk.
Lol and I don't know anyone...sorry that was weird of me to ask.
thats the best type of drunk
trust me im an expert at being obnoxiously drunk
no?
i must have sent you videos
I don't think I've ever seen you drunk

Wow. Getting funky in here

Lol true
you need liquids to survive
true
I m
üçª
oops
to drunk
you didnt vote hard enough
You should've spent it better.
should we have spent more or less?
Lol. You guys fucked up on your comms budget
what did we do
i dont know too much about the story
ah
#rekt
You and lyft spend upwards of 8 million to get prop 1 passed. And lost out to a campaign only funded by about 170k.
oh god
Yah you guys could've been like
i can see that
yeah
Probably a combination of lack of market study, bad pr team, bad ad team and arrogant legal team.
we shoulda just use that 8 mil to commit voter fraud instead
id go to the concert and then vote for whomever anyway
i wouldnt vote for something just cuz they threw a concert
would htat actually work
loool
Lol
We host a concert for you for 8 mil, please vote for us k
Lol. It was a joke. But it's more about the fact that you guys didn't get to know the Austin market and realize the things that sway their voting patterns. #1 of which is support of local businesses and ecosystems
yeah thats no good
ahhh
This convo color actually works nicely for Lyft.
Lol
i hate how theres no black color
üê´
Do you work out at a gym?
üê´
Oh I want to work out but idk how to do anything but cardio
i really should start again
But now at Uber?
but then i got sick and couldnt go and then i got better and never went back
at fitness sf
i used to
hahaha
Will you teach me?
Yeah I think I need to learn to do weights
i hate cardio
i used to only do weights
you want to do weights?
ohhh
thats some motivation to start going again hahaha
i can teach you
okkk
fitness sf
we have a gym right across the street though
we dont :(
Ohh
so thats part of why i stopped going
I go to Planet fitness in FiDi. Do you guys have an uber gym?
but koushik left uber, ari got lazy, and cam started doing a different routine from us
i used to go to the gym with koushik ari and cam
ahhh
I think he's not into it though.
does calvin also gym?
No he doesn't but he should
but i think first time visit is free
not sure
Can you guys bring guests?
Hmm can I join you next time? I'm super weak and pathetic right now but I want to get stronger and at least learn a routine I can do on my own
i dont have a next time yet
ok!!
All nights for now except Wednesday. I'm prioritizing gym rn.
when are you usually free
we can just pick a time
i used to try to go every day
ok let me figure out
ahh
Can you find out if your gym allows guests? I know that with my rate I pay, I can bring 1 guest at a time
thurs?
but rest of week is good for me
im actually busy today and tomorrow night
you can get a 3 day free pass
http://fitnesssf.com/free-pass/
ok dont think it allows guests but
Maybe tomorrow?
Let me know if there's a time that works for you this week!
Sure. How much is your membership?
Hmmm ok. Hopefully I can just learn from you on Thurs
normally its either 50 or 60 i forget
uber has a discount for employees
$40 a month iirc
the hard part though is that some of them need a spotter
i have a list of things i do
should be pretty simple
We'll both die
Uhhh I can't save you from weights
ill just do lower weights
its ok
LOL
probably would have to anyway since its been a long whiel since ive gone
K Thursday. Let's do it üí™
Ûæ≠û
Um when do you get off work?

but i can finish up whenever
so normally i stay for dinner and then leave afterwards
dinner is at 8 though
whenever
Uhhh I'd prefer to do smth before 8 but let me know what works best for you since you're the one doing me the favor
haha any time works for me honestly some days i show up to work at like noon and then go home at 4 pm, other days i show up at like 930 and then stay til 11 pm
ok we can do like 630 or 7?

I'm scared of stuff in the air lol. I don't have a fear of heights I don't think, but I'm scared of like sky diving or space
scared of the air??
waiiit whaat
Lol you know what I mean.
how come scared of sky diving or space?
if you arent scared of heights
wait i actually dont
i see what you mean then
ohhhh
I think for me it's the danger. I'm not an adrenaline person. Like I don't like fast cars. I like slow cars lol. But I did like the fast and furious movies.
so you prob dont like roller coasters eitehr right
but you dont want the thrill
you arent scared of the heights themselves
Wait no. I like roller coasters. And I like speed boats. Those don't feel as dangerous to me.
i used to be a scaredy cat
but only if its actually safe to
you arent afraid of going fast
not an issue of thrill
an issue of risk
so its actually just
oh interesting!
but then i started doing more things and now i love thrills
cuz my parents are super risk adverse and never let me do anything when i was young
Okay but like space scares me to the core - like deep ocean exploration does. Sor thing about the dark and being trapped and confined under all that pressure.
I don't want to die lol.
so far from everything
and alos
its claustrophobic
yeah
HEY. HEARD YOU SKIPPED WORK TODAY HUH?
but theres no such restriction at home
i have to put on pants to go into the office
at home
nah im working SUPER hard right now
!!!!!!!!!
*?
Lol are you still going to the foundry tonight!
hmmm ill see
ill come if i can catch up on the stuff i wanted to get done today
last few days of work ive had a ton of meetings and had to help the engineers working on my project with architecture decisions and answering their questions so i didnt get a lot of my own work done
so the real reason i wfh today is because i wanted to get some heads down time on my code
i totally forgot it's tuesday :(
O. No pressure. I was just asking for Calvin. I don't want to go to the Foundry that bad haha so we most likely won't go if no one else does
he already asked me too

To an emoji that's not the standard ones
on the phone
oh
Change the group emoji
i jsut craigslist
How do you
most places we find want you to move in immediately
its the only city where you cant look too early
D:
not on the phone
or a desktop client
messenger.com
you can only do it on computer
what did you want to change it to?
üè¢
Explore my options in life
No I want to
and ill find it
put the emoji here
Tell me about it
Dude
ugh apartment hunt is too hard
YEAH
gotta scope em out yourself
cant jsut have someone else dictate your preferences
thats true
LOL
but like
its annoying
Ugh
Can't fucking start looking?
I want to find an apartment for September
if you do its acutally much easier
did you say you and calvin will get a place together?
Bc a lot of postings are like "no couples"
I don't think so
Yah
wow rude
Yes lol
oh like they just dont let more than one person in a room?
what
how would they even know
?!
since now you have 2 people per room
is you can go for higher priced places
the good thing though
i feel like ive seen many places that doesnt say anything about that
Yah
Yeah
i got a speeding ticket in yolo county
#noyolo
ÛæåΩ
#nolo
heard about car
:(
Y u no send me PC snaps
what is it
do I have your Snapchat??
Graphics card?
brain surgery
replacing the cpu
To what?
Ohhh
let me see
its a uhh
but screen is not turning on ughhh
i7-4790K
dumbbb whawt a waste of time
amazons gonna send me a new one
ughh i think the motherboard is defective
they are shipping me a new one though!
But I haven't put in th time to diagnose it
That sucks though. I'm pretty sure my power supply or something has an issue
Yeah but it's the time thing üòû
yeah time is the biggest problem
whats wrong with your PSU?
but the time is not refundable
the money isnt an issue i wouldnt have bought it if i didnt want to pay for it
Idk
But all my drivers are fine
I'm not sure it's psu, but I keep getting power state driver failures
hmm
Tacky
Lol
ha ha ha
we can onboard you some new drivers
I have a million software's all customized
such a pain though
I think is about time to just reinstall everything
my comp has weird issues too
but hmm
is funny joke I laughed
*for?
Also - what do you use your PC force
I had to reformat my laptop recently. It sucked and now I have two operating system files and no idea how I did that or how to fix it lol
pretty much everything
Ohhh
my side projects, browsing reddit, watching movies, playing games, photoshop, photo editing back when i actually used my camera still, etc
its my primary computer at home
So you have really nice gpu then
got it last year
i have a gtx 970
yeah i think its software's fault
Yeah lol - I have 650Ti - it can do everything
my graphics card should be able to handle a lot of games with no problem but i get weird issues
Wow
but i think my windows installation is messed up
used to have a 460
I'm only ordering parts through a shop like Fry's
If I go back to Texas or smth
thats so annoying
Yeah
oh nooo
*mobo
and now this new one i bought was defective
Plot twist - it wasn't
My first mobile was listed as compatible with my other parts
got a new one and it would overheat
my very first motherboard had a recall
also i havent had good luck with motherboards
LOL
and had an issue where the SATA port would disconnect once every 48 hours
Lol
Cuz then no wait time and they're responsible if something goes wrong in your hardware
And their service team is really good
Fry's has a really good stock
Oh. Idk. Idk if they have fry's here. I don't trust Best Buy
oh why is texas related?
er we have frys*
i love frys
they have frys!
So if smth is damage you can just drive there and swap it
Oh...well that's the point though. That in TX gets has a lot in stock
usually just refund you no questions asked
amazon has amazing support policy as well
but i usually just get from amazon
theres none inside SF but if you just do delivery its fine
And you can pick parts for them to build it for you
i used to just have my EE friends do it for me
its so stressful
i hate building
i wonder if frys here can do it
oh they can build for you!
ahh
whooooo
new one works
YESS
I can't find the second link
After the apt you said you liked
Wait what was the apt you sent me
not the spear one right?
oh let me see

You're worrying your bae
I was taking a nap
LOL
I shower and coem
LOL
üè¢
Also we're gonna live with Chirag
üè¢
omg #blessed
Why
!!!
üò°
Our other roommates dropped out lol
so you are ok with him?
haha I'm kidding
o
how is that relevant to my question LOL
wait
I just hope he knows better than to bring girls home who are no his gf
ya fair point
Mm I'll give him the benefit of the doubt
Just - we'll see
but no more moral reservations?
He seems ok
haha
Haha it's slightly
then you just change the locks on his door
ya
Haha
take pic
or
üè¢
and blackmail him for free rent
lol
üè¢
did Chirag say yes?
Yeah
what was his reason
ewww
Which sucks since he initially agreed on 2.7k when he showed me the place
But we had to increase the price by 100 a month
üòï
He just said he needed more time otherwise to think about it
He didn't give a reason
that's kinda shady
So we had to come up and match
I'm betting his other candidates were offering more
Yeah
that's kinda shady
uh
Ryan also agrees
and you already have some reservations about him morally
I feel like this move is pretty shady on his part
I personally think it's not a good idea to move there
and can reduce your life satisfaction a lot
Yeah. Well I don't think we'll have drama
roommate drama is the worst
don't want you to have issues down the line
I just think that since who you live with is pretty important to you
And it's a good place
I mean I understand. But I think it's our only option
I mean up to yu haha
hahaha
Thank Ryan
Lol
We don't really have another option now
And I dont think hes a bad person per se
But our rooms are far apart
True
Yeah
Yeah
just that make sure you can respect him
I'm not saying I wouldn't live with him
ya maybe not
Idk. I'm going to try to make this work.
It really is our only option right now
well I support the decision
:/
:) yeah! We'll definitely have a dinner or smth
place looks great
I want to visit!
hope it works out for you
üòÄ
yayy

even if people are around
i just chill in my boxers and turn on the heat
when im at home and dont wanna wear my normal clothes
why do you have them
o!
And sometimes my legs get cold when I sleep
Lol well we have a roommate so I can't just walk around without pants all the time so I have PJ bottoms that are comfy
have you heard of that before?
i use this thing called a blanket
oohh
So I feel cold all the time.
I have a very warm natural body temperature
lol I do use a blanket
Oh. Idk that's just my own logic lol
i walk around in tshirts in like todays weather and think its too warm
cuz i feel hot all the time
might explain me then
thats a thing?
hmmm
It's probably not true, but I always feel like I'm losing heat to the environment

Got progressively worse
Too much food
Very yummy
LOL
Oh how come?
but im trying to get them to move it to saturday instead
coworker invited me to something that night
im down but i need to figure out
oo cool
Would you be interested?
Thinking about it
are yall going?
oh this masquarade thing
i wanna check it out!
Ahh
i kinda wanna check it out
oh because earlier in the night our apartment has a happy hour event
yall wanna go on sat
also ryan wants to go to bootie
yeaa haha
Haha
My friend Jenn and I were going to Bootie Saturday
Omg LOL
It's Katy/Miley mash up night
so down!
!!!
we join you?
that sounds fun hahahaha
Us
Better help is
So
Haha ok but just know my goal is to get my friend a boyfriend
ohhh ok
Noice
down
though ryan is asexual
bonus points if you find ryan and me cute girls
Is he!
and I met him in freshmen year of hs
he's never expressed interest in anyone nor dated anyone since I've known him
not sure br feels like he is
Have you ever asked him
That's pretty cool.
No way.
Wow!
Oh wow really?
you can't really choose to be or not to be interested in someone
which is fine but
he says he rather focus on other things in life
I call him asexual all the time
ya I make fun of him for it
Look in his history
actually that's a good point
Oh I know a good way
Has he ever said a girl is pretty or hot or whatever?
Like maybe he just hasn't been close enough to anyone to feel that way
Mmm I think you can
unless just asexual
Web browsing history lol
Idk
but that doesn't really mean much
I mean he has said that girls are good looking
nahhhh
LOL
More than once
Has he ever watched porn
Idk why would he not tell you
Yeah but
üò°
but not interested
Food
I can tell when guys are food looking too
its kinda awkward
i dont like to discuss porn with my friends
id prefer not to know these things
i dont know
LOL
LOL
then every night id be like oh god is he jacking off right now
"yeah i watch porn every day usually right before i sleep"
what if he tells me
IN YOUR ROOM
i just dont wanna think about their porn habits
Is Ryan a virgin? Maybe he's shy about it
actually its less that it's awkward
hehe
which i doubt considering how little interest he seems to have in girls
i mean unless he had some one night stands in college
yeah i think he is
i bet he'll like get married or something one day
ok i dont think hes 100% asexual
That might be it
but im not sure though
But
Don't get me wrong, it's totally cool to be asexual
Maybe he's just a little not-confident
Well that's probably it then
Ohhh
he can totally get someone if he wanted to
but hes not horrible or anything
Like what usually happens there
are not by choice
like some guys who are virgins at this age
Yeah I didn't think so
and hes not like bad with girls either
Do girls not hit on him?
Hmm
but it does just feel like he doesn't really find it that much of a priority
Ew do I want to hear this
What
took turns
she uh
its not
LOL
yeah he just rejects
LOL
Like does he just reject girls that confess to him?
acutally the same girl has hit on both of us before
haha girls have hit on him
and he said no
hahaha
and like hit on him too
she met ryan
and then like later on
because i wasnt that interested
i didnt end up dating her
we hung out etc
she was intersted in me
LOl
i just meant like
im not gonna go tmi
shes the girl i took pic with in my haloween costume
Pics
Wait
Haha well I mean that's not surprising
Maybe she's not his type
She's not my type tho
Oh. I think I saw y'alls pics
oh I mean him rejecting this one girl once isn't why I think he's asexual
ya
Anyway
My type
The girl in front
given it's the bay area haha but still almost everyone i know has dated at least a little bit (or a lot) by now
just the fact that hes never once been interested in anyone for the 11 years ive known him
(She's married but shhhhh)
Or interested
Ask Ryan if he thinks she's pretty
Wait
hahahahaha
i bet he'll say no
ok ill ask
LOL
What how!!! She's the most beautiful girl
hes never been interested in anyone
yeah
No - to interested
This girl I knew from sorority
oh he might say yes to if shes pretty
who is she?
he hasnt answered yet
Wait he said no?!
whats your answer

Ryan Kwong
geez i don‚Äôt know
whats her personality like

Jason
LOL
physically
is she pretty?

Ryan Kwong
sure i guess
She's a kindergarten teacher
She has a beautiful heart
Omg he's sensitive
And pure
Super kind
Really into smiling, dogs, sports.
Ok
ok ill give him these details
aww
So he said no?
He thought I was trying to set him up w someone lol
He asked if I knew anyone who wanted a headshot
hahahahaha
T________T
did he ask you?
just laughed
he didnt give me an answer
LOOL
And he said "oh is it the friend you're trying to set me up with"
And I said my friend does (talking actually about a friend)
were his next words "don't bother I'm asexual"
LOOOL
I WANT TO KNOW NOW
LOL no
or like has less libido than average
I bet he's a little asexual
me too
LOL
Ask him about porn
You have to do it
no iunno
LOOL
"hey recommend me some good porn sites"
What do I say
:)
you ask
whyy
well dont tell me his answer
dont tell me
if you find out
i dont really want to know the answer either
honestly i dont know
LOL
LOL
LOL like I could ask that
If a girl asked you that, you'd probably think she has some sort of problem
unless it came up organically
id think its weird too
if a guy asked me that
well to be fair
LOL
Lol how
Lao probably not masquerade tomorrow if we doing Bootie
got invited to a friends bday
i might end up clubbing tomorrow anyway LOL

Getting drunkkkkkk
hmm
If you would be coming to Hawaii, is there anyone else you'd like to come along?
I'm just trying to get a sense of if this group will be like 4 or 6+.
i can if you want me to add a few suggested people
do you want me to ask some people?
hang out with*
but like any of my friends i usually hyang out with
no one in particular i dont think
oh not jacq dont think jacq was there
you hung out with them at santacon
Yeah sure I don't know them that well
yeah
Not like 10+ people inv
well we can see if robin / jacqueline are down
ohh ok
But sure
Yeah maybe! Maybe not like too many lol
LOL
they are nice
vvvlike
V v v like
they are cool you will like
okk
But sure!
Yeah I don't think I've met her
serge / connie?
Ok. Anyone else? If we have a really big group, it might be better for getting a nicer Airbnb, but also cars will be an extra cost so I'm trying to budget things based off an estimate
ok im a bit weary of inviting more work people
Not to banff
he hates fun
He should come
iknow
Ryan is lame too
cam maybe
ikr
Lame
who dont hang out
Lol why
they prob will be lame and not wanna go tho
they have become the lame couple
Ok cool!!!
been wantign to check it out
i havent!
hahaha
since most of them only hang out with other people on our team
the people on my team are ok though
Have you been to Hawaii?
Yeah bc it's hard to eat at small places or coordinate
because some times people invite the whole group
yeah
Also I don't want like a group of too many
but then thatd be too big of a group
Yeah....
or like its a bit rude to only invite some and not invite others
i love food
luau sounds so much fun
yeah!!
ok ill ask robin / jacq
Yeah me too. I want to go to a real luau
cool!
And eat poke
Yeah I want to hula
also
yaaa
Oh I went last year. Idk. I didn't have a good time. Idk if I'm a rave person. People kept elbowing me in the head and I had a fever.
?
https://www.facebook.com/events/1768230786830871/
galantis
never at raves
only time ive gotten hurt is during a rock concert
ive never had that happen to me
what!!
Do you get hurt during raves? Is that normal?
Hope it's not violent like Blink 182
I can't wait for Simple Plan
im glad he didnt try to fight me
i know
That's intense
LOL
LOL
and he walked away
i got mad and threw the rest of the beer at him
and made me spill my beer
like people were literally running around swinging their arms
not a mosh pit
at a blink182 concert people started a dance pit
Oh lol
Hahah
and one person kept hitting me
hahaha
just that one area
well most of the concert is fine
hopefully not
>.> he should go even if I don't go
calvin said he'll go to galantis if you go
LOL
robin tang and jacqueline cheong
so they can see the details
can you just add them to the event?
oh yeah
Hi did you ask robin and his boo
Oh yeah
An you let them know I invited so I'm not a creep
yeah
Hey so robin says it will depend on his work if he can go to hawaii. So IDK if this will go through D:
ah yeah
so its pretty hard to plan ahead for them
ah yeah cuz he's in start up
so he needs like a week or two to find out
D:
hmm
D':
üéÉ
maybe $150
it's like a $100 difference or so
but I guess for people who are a bit richer
they're like the cheapest of the year right now
Thats what I'm worried about.
would the tickets get really expensive?
what if we just plan last minute
wait how much are they right now?
or er $450
like $500 round trip
oh hmm
is that expensive? Should I warn people
im down for that price
iunno what peoples budgets are
yeah - it's actually one of the cheapest times of year. No idea why.
oh probably bc there aren't holidays
ahhaha
interesting
oh that makes sense actually
hahahaha
LOL
mean
>:(
Ew
serge and connie thing
What's next weekend

Womp womp
Oh I did not get an invite lol
not like inviting some stranger no one knows
your his gf thats reasonable

Nooo
so they prob invited you!
guests dont have a button to invite
Yeah idk
its a private event
wait how did he invite you
come
loool
Lol! Calvin invited me
Lol no that's so rude!
And I said I think it's rude for him to invite me
like if he brought a few random friends no one has met before
Rude
i wouldnt even notice
and they brought their SO whom i know
if i invited someone to my party
yeah it is!
It's not polite!
I think Calvin is going
LOL no she wouldn't
connie would be sad
itd be rude not to come
thatd be rude
So it will be A-OK

Don't ask

but I've spent 100 in one meal before and was still fine
technically the same
ohh
I spent as much as I want LOL
lol nice
where are you eating
hahaa
So it's not bad
NY food is more affordable and yummy than SF though
I already ate but I went to a Congee place bc I was sick. I wanted to explore SoHo but it's like 20 degrees out and sick.
dirty expensive weird sf
but all the good tech is in sf :(
I'd like to move there
yaaa
will visit again this year to visit my friend there
I love this city! Very pretty :)
Ah
no only been once :(
Do you know NY well?
damn it's so cold!
ahhh
If I could eliminate just the danger element though SF would be fine
there's some jobs there not too bad but not as good as sf for tech
ya
Yeah... same lol
recently they arrested all the druggies in civic center
A hobo grabbed Jenn by the necklace
I know so crazy
:(
snatched*
sf
ya in sg
is NYC safe?
someone snayched it out of his hand
in SF?
Way safer than SF

I saw someone pull a knife
the side closer to mission is jank

two homeless had an argument
crazy person
Omg. Like threaten another crazy person or someone walking by on the street?
But I'm glad there are people brave enough to do so
That seems like a terrible idea
I would never try to pull apart a knife fight
and no fight happened
oh but they were crazy people too LOL
What time were you planning on leaving today?
Can we push it back a bit? Or are we coordinating times with another group

But I guess he found us all on FB? Haha
I don't think I even talked to the guy
Yeah lol now
Well this should be interesting. I wonder who's all going
He said Jason Libby's team
if it wasnt for the fact that i left this would be no different than just grabbing dinner with a new coworker
Yeah I heard
and hes gonna be working on basically my team at uber
meeting new people is fun
its not that weird
haha iunno
vehicle solutions
ye
And I'm horrible at meeting people at bars
Yeah I guess I just don't really remember talking to other people Saturday so I was a bit surprised.
ah haha

I'm visiting parents
sorry just saw this :(
oh shit
No worries! Everything worked out :)
where did yall end up going
:)
We just did Bay to Breakers instead! Calvin went with his group of friends and I went with mine. It was pretty cool. I've never been before.
did you dress up
nice!
oooo
Yeah lol. I went as Nick from Zootopia
pics
o!!!
None lol. My friends took the photos
make them upload later
oh lame
Are those the tickets?
yess
So pretty
üéÉ
Sunday night - plans?
im free sat night tho
congay napa trip :(
Is congay - company?
Oh boo. I'm only free Sunday night. There's a free play night at coin-op
what thinking?
congay
con + gei
connie + sergei
congay is serge and connie
:(
congay airlines
LOL
That sounds like a shitty airline lol
loool
Does Connie hate me? Just wondering. Bc I was going to see if she wanted to get coffee
hahahaha
why would she hate you?
I don't think she does
did it seem like that
why did you think she hates you?
i meant like
no i dont mnean
ive not heard anything about that
Idk. Bad first impressions?
Test the waters before swimming or something something
But I don't know that she likes me. So I just wanted to check.
dont see why she would
i dont think she dislikes you
just ask her
havent heard her mention you at all
i havent heard anything
shes prob neutral?
iunno
hahahahahaha
Good.
have some more confidence!
do you just assume most people you meet dont like you?
thats funny
hahahaha
hahaa
Well for Connie I think it's different because we've met before and different events but haven't talked much
if she doesnt like someone she says it outloud
so you'll be good
shes a very very no drama person
hahaha
Yeah but like....girls.
theres plenty of people ive seen at events but never talked to
that still doesnt suggest she dislikes you
so since i havent heard any thing bad you should be good
most guys i know are more complicated than her
like shes low drama even by guys standards
Sweet
loool
if shes not down it doestn mean she doesnt like you
she tends to stay home and play with milo tho
100%
I will take it as she hates me
great
where
üéÉ
üéÉ
Home
Omg I had the same tiny ketchup yesterday
it's so cute
oo
Weekend plans?
I have no plans üòõ
Oh lol I was going to ask if I could borrow your Costco card
you?
I'm going camping haha
Yeah I think so üòû
they check sometimes for me
dont they check your id
hmm
ooo
It's okay though!
But that's why I asked. I was going to see if you were going to Costco and I could tag along lol
its pretty cheap
split it with calvin
just get a card!
ohhh
Uhhh lol
Might not work out that way.
?
im curious to know more but of course you dont have to say anything if you dont want to
shit im sorry :(
oh no!
Lol we broke up a bit ago
hows the rooming situation now?
aww
It's ok! We're still good. I just don't have anyone to split costs with now for Costco üòõ
I think the only bad part is it's been awk telling people since we have mutual friends and we had all these events that we still went to together.
I'm hopefully moving out in July.
when did it happen?
yeah totally
Just like a few weeks ago.
aww :(
Just didn't work out. I think we're not the best people for each other.
what happened :(
But we're still good friends so all's good. :)
do you know where you will move to?
thats good!
aww haha
Still in SoMA but I think I have a place lined up
LOL
i dont have any real arguments to convince you other than it will be fun
you should move to ava
but just curious haha
oh nah i dont :/
ooo nice
Why do you know someone with an opening?
LOL. Too much $$$$ for me
is it possible to find stuff cheaper than that in soma?
whats your budget?
LOL
for a 2b2b
2k per person
we pay more than that haha
nice!
oh thats cheap!
With private bath hopefully :)
The place I'm looking at is $1400
How much do you guys pay?
Yeah lol I figured.
where is it?
1400 isnt bad
yeah =/
By LinkedIn :) super great location too.
I've had my eye on his place for like the past few months lol
Ian lives there now, so that's how I knew about it
ah gotcha
Oh really? I thought your new office was by Uber
No I think like 4

let me double check
friday should work!
ohhhh
oh wait i have an all hands meeting on fri
yeah
i think hed be down
Cool.
just tell him you are interested in talking about the role
i dont think so
Would it be weird if I reached out to him for coffee? I've been wanting to talk to someone again in that role
yeah you can get to meet him again too
but i htink you can prob just message him should be ok
worst case you can just set something up once you see him again when you come
üéÉ
üéÉ

np!
Omg lollllll
hi
I keep matching with people I know
Lolllll
LOOL
and like immediately you showed up
and swiped a little
so i opened it
i havnet opened the app in a while, and suddenly got a match
LOL
yeah ive seen so many friends on there
loool
Awkkkk
oh gosh
I matched with Calvin yesterday
cuz it even shows our mutual friends
they8 totally know who your friends are
like
I KNOW RIGHT
i thought these apps are all supposed to not show first degree connections
guess not haha
I downloaded it literally yesterday
Here let me find one real quick
what does that accomplish
LOL
It makes it blue.
i dont even know what superliking does
i always superlike when i see a friend
That they will guarantee match
you dont have to apologize for that guy
LOL
It just shows
Sorry my Elo is low rn. I think it's bc I haven't been on Tinder for very long
loool
whats the point of that tho
wait
See?
but then id swipe right regardless
i mean unless they are super great
loool
cuz it seems kinda desperate
id just be less inclined
if i was a girl and saw someone do that
oh i see
So you feel better or are like flattered and might swipe right more likely
i feel like
Yah
it will show up blue
so when you see my account
its been 5 minutes
aite why havent you matched me yet
Have you been on a tinder date before?
Yah. Well I've swiped on ones that seem nice and have blue even if I'm not interested to elo boost safely
cuz you know he already liked you back
you know you wont waste a swipe if the guy seems good
i guess its like
yeah
It's nice if the guy seems nice
yeah iunno
yeah oh well
Rough
O dang
loool
and i just stopped responding afterwards for every single one
but i wasnt very interested
none of them were too bad
nah it wasnt too bad
this is unacceptable
Is it awk?
a few
yeah i have
now im kinda embarassed
hold up
yeah sure
either not good looking, or very fobby, or just kinda boring
i dont get good matches
i think i dont put enough effort into my profile
havent been on a good tinder date before
I want to see your profile now to evaluate
LOL
in blue
and you'll see me
just swipe a lil
Hahaha
actually wait
I saw a really clever one from a guy recently. Instead of like ENFJ or whatever, his was PBNJ
let me see
its prob super corny
i havent touchced the description in like years i think
LOL why is your second pic your car
im not good at being witty without context
yeah my profile is kinda boring i think
there we go
what is dragon
LOL
#dragon
LOL
no
wat
Aren't dragons the people who are sexually attracted to cars
Hahaha
its ok i wont judge
is this your secret fetish?
LOOL
which you subscribed me to after grabbing my phone that one time
dragonsfuckingcars
i think you are thinking of the reddit sub
But hello
Ok don't be sad - I'm going to nope you bc I don't want you to see my tinder profile anymore
hahahahaa
that is so rude!
Yes
oh are you gonna add some dragonfuckingcars pics now?
LOL no
wait you said a while back that you like ugly guys or something
Hahahaha
LOL THAT DRAGON
so how would you improve my profile
Idk. Do you want a girl who likes all the hobbies you like?
LOL
so dont give me advice like "look uglier"
And put more pics of yourself
im like less inclined to swipe on them
like when i see people with super perfect photos
I think that's fine
hahahaha
but they are all a lil too professional looking
he has
hmm maybe
but i feel like
Get Ryan to take them!
i dont have enough pics of myself i think
cuz im too lazy loool
i dont like taking pics of myself
again i didnt put much thought into any of this
so i figure just write some shit i like iunno
but i just listed them because i didnt know what to write loool
i dont want her to be boring
i mean thats def a plus
i dont actually care if the girl likes the hobbies i like
What makes a girl boring?
lool
thye have no hobbies and no interests and have nothing to talk about
people i wouldnt be freinds with normally
oh like some of these were just boring people
dont know how to banter and tease and just dont have much to say loool
also some are just really bad at talking
as long as are willing to have fun and try things
i think no hobbies is not even that bad
Ahh I see. Dating is so complicated
ye
hahahaha
Are you going to LA?
also theres a bday party i want to go to this weekend so i prob wont be going
hahaha

hahha
I'm bored
How much are Ava 2 bedrooms?
4k to 4.7
oooo
I just got screwed out of my new place and am looking at a converted living room in yalls building tomorrow
This floor plan? Do you know?
Ah I see
how much are they charging?
there were identical floorplans that had like $500 diff in price
when i looked
Ah
oh
the price isnt based just on the floorplan
its pretty random
$1440
Which I think is a little high, but I'm not really in a negotiating position
And windows all around it
so its pretty good privacy wise
not like our living room
Yeah, but still no walls and no closet
i guess they prob are just splitting the rent 3 ways
one for each bedroom
i mean based on that floor plan
the living room is off to the side
Since I have no alternative lol
I'm still open to it
you can prob buy like one of those privacy curtains
looks like the doorway is pretty narrow
and no closet too
but yeah no door is annoying
i like windows!
maybe you can just get a dresser
i thin kthe windows are a plus
er like standing closet i mean
Well it's hard to have so many curtains to block light but yeah
Ah. I see
nono all the windows come with curtains
even in living room
yeah
they arent just naked windows
yeah
Does Ava have gym?
i dont like light
but its same as in the bedroom though
Ah that's ok though.
i just use an eyemask
but in the day
Ah well I wasn't sure how well they covered out that much light
so
LOL
at night they are fine
lool
it does get a little bright
Oh. I thought that was public gym
you were gonna come to the ava gym like a year ago remember
LOL
nono not the one you came to
the one you were going to
haha
Ah.
Well I'm trying to stay positive about it. What're yalls utilities like?
hmm
let me check
oh and internet is 25 per person per month
so like 40 a person per month
Trash Collections 		$23.00
Gas/HWE-Util.Vndr.Billed 		$9.19
Sewer-Util.Vndr.Billed 		$30.08
Utility service fee 		$2.76
Water-Util.Vndr.Billed 		$18.36
Ah so $65 between 2
yeah roughly
Ah thanks!
when are you looking
Tomorrow at 6:30
oh thats fine
Oh I'm not moving until July 7 though

Booooo
üéÉ
üòÆ Wow
someone had a dragon???
omg
Jason. The heck man.
?
oh snap
he just told me
do what you feel is right
Did you ok it?
do whatever you wanna
or like
so a while back he said
would you mind if i ask her out
i said i dont see why i would mind
but shes a friend
ahahahaha
nah i wasnt like
YOU SHOULD ASK HER OUT DUDE
No it's fine. We cool.
i dont think its that bad
I thought you were being an instigator
i dont like matchmaking people
you can both move on
Ok
if you said yes and it worked out id be happy for yall
if you said no
its such a lame middle school thing to do
then its no big deal
really?
But I'm not very good at it.
LOL
I love match making
who have you tried to matchmake
And girls here are too precious
Though your friend steph is real cute
too precious?
No one here lol. I don't know enough girls
LOL what does that mean
Like just. I love them all and I done want them to be hurt
ahh yeah
i personally think that it's always ok to take the risk
as long as the person isnt known to be a dick
everyones a dude in tech :(
shouldnt you know more girls than i do???
maybe if i knew more girls
Maybe you should invite more girls to your things üòâ
Yah that makes sense
I wish. I'm trying to meet more girls
But a lot of girls I meet are taken so....yeah. Which is totally cool. For me.
guys arent trying to date every girl they see
at least im not
iunno about other guys
i mean thats fine too
hahaha
You're special
well i doubt other guys are interested in every girl they see
LOL
i guess so
i feel like if that's the case no one would ever complain about dating
that someone is seeing / matched on tinder / is interested in etc
What do you mean?
LOL
theres been so many times when i was talking to some girls about some other girls
are girls really bad at judging how attractive other girls are
or are yall just being nice
happens a lot though
im pretty sure youve done it too
Girls are WAYYY more harsh about girl looks than guys
dunno how i suddenly remebered it
To be nice.
Show me a pic
oh this isnt any specific example
and the response is always like
even when they are kinda ugly
LOL
omg shes sooo cute
Oh lol. They're lying.
yeah i figured as much
Yeah lol
But to be fair
hahaha
about someone he went on a date with?
Um, I've done it like once recently lol.
like when youve looked through my apps before
You guys all said she was cute too
LOL
I don't think I did it to you
and said everyone is sooo pretty
and im like what
LOL
wait
I did it to Jason Libbey lol (don't tell him)
was i there?
His bumble date
i might have been being nice too
i dont remember who this person was
Yeah
oh hmm
Like do you remember the girl in the black like bralette/bustier he showed us?
when was this?
i dont quite remember at all loool
And I was like "oooh"
hmm
I think like "cute" might be a lie a lot of the times
Like when we went to that bar in Chinatown
But then he showed me her pic again this past week
dud you ugly af
LOL
all his guy friends will be like
but when a guy uploads an ugly pic
i guess my memory sucks
its just being nice
i find it funny tho
"Really pretty" is like honest
At least for me
intereting
even if she doesnt look good in it
so when you say shes cute
But cute doesn't always mean it's a lie
she might not actually be cute
true
yeah
Sometimes she's just cute
a million girls will come out of nowhere and be like OMG YOU ARE LIKE SO PRETTY
agreed
yeah
LOL
when like a girl uploads a new photo on fb
i find it so funny
Girls say like subtle things to say you're ugly
Also - I feel like guys take way more selfies than girls
and will take wahtever and upload them
guys just dgaf
LOL really?
oh i think part of it is
when girls take selfies the y wanna look perfect
You take a lot of selfies lol
true
usually there's a reason for it tho!
like hair
LOL
Or bc you're drunk
LOL
LOL
thats true i take a lot of selfies when im drunk
but like not by myself
oh yeah probably
with eveyrone around
cuz im like OMG FRANNNDSS LETS TAKE PICS
O true
loool
üêô
What is
iunno haha i was getting bored of the jackolantern
so i just picked a random
O
üêô
its an octopus
Bc I had a little to drink and was too friendly
how was your date
LOL
:D
O!
Uhhhhh
O
It went really well. But now he's being a bit weird
how is it weird?
is he being too friendly now
So....idk. It's weird now. But the date was good.
oh
I like strongly told him to tone it down lol
But yeah I didn't realize it would be offputting to me
Yeahhh
Idkkk
what is he doing lool
like flirting really hard?
Yeahhhhhh
ahhh
WHOA

I might be more awake after I eat food today
Hey - I might pass on drinks tonight. Im a little tired and want to just do home stuff. But what time are y'all going to bars?
Like right after?
ooo
im not too sure
after dinner i guess
no
North?
But you're passing it right?
:3
tehres no IKEA there :P
unless you mean today
didnt make any specific plans
Which ways is oysters
lets ask the group
East bay?
north
North?
Wanna drive me to IKEA
tomorrow morning?
i mean we can go today if you want
like now or something LOL
but its not on the way haha
iunno when they close
No?
No it's right across the bridge
Haha I can't. They close at 9 and I'm still at work
Qq
its north bay not east bay
Aw ok
ikea is in east bay and south bay
East bay is kind of north
well peninsula
loool
nah it's east
yeah
Lol ok
So I'll just like Bart there tomorrow morning
kk
tomales is ggbridge
i mean i dont mind doing you a favor just that i dont have time tomorrow
vs tomorrow
is the same amount of out of the wayness for me
as in 100% of the trip will be out of the way no matter which day it is
ahhh lame
And you don't need to go to east bay haha
i mean
going today
Yah but I don't want to take you out of the way lol
not bay bridge
would be down today cuz im not doing anything rn
are you buying a lot of stuff
how will yo utake it back on bart
I was going to maybe get IKEA to ship it? Idk.
ohhh that makes snese
sense*
Idk. But I guess I could UberXL
Oh I like your plan.
it became dinner instead
so i should be free afterwards
haha
is a good plan :D
I thought you had a thing tomorrow though, no?
Dude that thread
And no one responded to my bar question lol
i totally forgot i had to wake up early tomorrow
It was kind of last minute but honestly I don't like when people decide things last min either lol
im confused
I think he just doesn't like when people change plans
i dont know what aki's saying
Last minute
yeah
but its so passive aggressive lool
which is another reason why we should jsut do tomorrow
but he doesnt know that you cant make today
I can make today
I think it's fine. I just don't want him to be upset though
if he doestn want to just say nah id rather do today and thats fine
so why not just do it tomorrow which works out better for everyone
Well I'm like not down for tonight nown
yeah
aki loves planning shit last minute
ah gotcha
like what vibe of place
why does place matter?
Yeah
But no one gave a time or place
So it's a bit last minute if I were to go out.
makes sense
time makes sense
do your preparations change depending on where we're going?
Bc I need to plan an outfit
Yeah
ya
That's why I asked earlier lol.
Thick?
i dont know what that means LOL
he was messaging me earlier saying like
"the host is being thick so i prob wont go"
he always invites me to things like an hour before
and im like uh i have work
Well I think he wanted to do today bc that house party?
oh i dont think he even wanted to go
but if it's too late for you to plan to go out now should let him know
im ok with it
üêé
well iunno
im down to go tonight if he insists
no idea
i didnt ask
Lol
Like THICC
;)
so he should go then LOL
i mean jsut let him know
cuz the reason i brought it up to move to tomorrow
yeah
is because both you and i find today inconvenient
im not just doing it to be a dick
It's not it's just inconvenient lol. Bc now Calvin and I are going to eat food
i dont want him to think im just arbitrarily changing plans for no reason
but he doesnt know that you find it inconvenient too
or i can tell for you
Your message overkill lol
Omg
I msged
*thjng
I just don't want Aki to feel like we're ganging up on him
No it's not a taking the fall thigh
i brought it up because of what you said
just letting me take the fall for it is pretty mean
well i mean
Jason
Lol
*are
sure
It makes sense why you ask
I don't think it seems like you're arbitrarily doing it
vs if one person is just like
yo fuck yall lets do tomorrow because thats what i want
so the alternative is make it seem like im arbitrarily chagning plans
its just things came up
i dont think its ganging up
if a bunch of people are now inconvenient
it makes sense to move it
Lol
yeah iunno
i really dont like passive aggressive
even though we both wanted to change the plans
like im down to still go today
I think it will be fine.
but he still seems a bit upset
if he prefers today he shoulda just said it
so it woulda been directed 100% at me
Yeah. His message was a little pa sorry
and i woulda accomodated
i dont mind accomodating at all
Jesus Aki
hahahaha
Idk. I just don't want it to be the three of us if Aki is mad lol
are you thinking of inviting someone?
technically iunno
LOL
Ok but like technically I don't know that it's supposed to be a small group eighth
*right?
usually we get over it quick
quick to anger quick to forget
unless its something really emotional
but i gradually forced myself to care less
Idk. Ok
guys are simple creatures
Ok yeah maybe
Lol dude
oh i dont think hes mad
I'm just really nervous about making people upset
yeah i understand
im like that too
well i used to be just like you
a lot of times its impossible to please everyone
especially if you want to organize things or be a leader
its hard sometimes because espeically living in a city
both in career and life
when i first lead projects at work
I don't mind caring lol, I just have to mitigate it a lot. Having more people in a group usually gets morale up lol
i foudn it really hard to tell people to work harder
or do a bertter job and stuff
and didnt want to upset them
but like if you want to help them sometimes you have to
i always felt really bad
so sometimes you just gotta tell people yo stop
and it might upset them
and make a ton of requests and demands that end up inconvencining other people
but if you dont it will upset other people
when i plan events
lotsa people dont realize
Yeah I get it for work.
for life too a lot of times
Yah true
yeah life is hard
i want a secretary
ooo yas
Wait did you go to Costco today?
WITHOUT MEEEE

Thanks so much!!!
sounds good
no problem!
https://www.taskrabbit.com/r/3m2a3/try
They set it upfront and you pick people
do you set the price yourself
arbitrarily
oo yaas
Yeah
oh thats actually so cool
Do you need referral code?
sure
No, you pay ppl by the hour
ah gotcha
so its a standard rate
It's different from person to person
ahhh interesting
Yah they can do a bunch of things, even like wait in line lol
LOL yeah i heard of people doing that
for like restaurants with huge wait
I like the reviews too
can prob make a decent amount of money doing this part time
for skilled labor
Yeah
o wow
some people charge quite high
what else have you used it for
It's a bit too pricey for anything else I want
Just moving!
but now im clickign around on it
and i realize i cant actually think of anything for them to do
yeah makes sense
it sounded so convenient
Yah you really need a task
But you can hire for cleaning too
Or like - if you need a personal assistant for a day
ya could be useful to get you out of hare-y situations
Yeah. There are use cases where it would be bunnyficial.
oh damnit i was trying to think of a bunny one
thats not bad
Ikr. I thought of it and had to seize the hopportunity.
here we go down the rabbithole
ehhh
these are kinda a leap
where the puns are all the highest carrot gems
You have an aBUNdance of poor jokes.
these puns are hopping lower and lower in quality
lower and lower down in quality*
So conflicted...
The pig is so cute but 9gag....

#repost
Lol what is that subreddit thoigh
*though
With just your posts
Why do you have so many subreddits lol
LOL
just for this vid
i just made it
LOL
how did you find all the subs with just my posts
U/razor_storm lol
oh is there a tab thta shows all the subs i made?
loool
Your post history
i dont make posts that much
Yah
how far back did you scroll????
oh i guess that makes sense
they are good
Ok will do
enjoy my empty subs
mostly comments
thanks
enjoy them well
also pay me $0 for oysters
because you ate 0
dont undersell yourself
you consider yourself too cheap so i refuse to pay
sorry i cant afford you
thats more like it
#planned
Yes
would you lie to me
oh thats good
I enjoy lies
tell a few more
$1 per lie. $10 and up for each that have compromising real life implications.
give a free taste of both packages first
I need a test drive before committing to something like this
I can tell you a half lie for a sample but that's all.
I may or may not have a fear of boomerangs
hmm
ill tell you half a lie as well
Ok. But don't be nervous if it's not good as mine. I charge for professional services for a reason
i may or may not actually be a boomerang
#triggered
#mayormaynotbetriggered
What do? Ignore? Reply? Apologize?
your font is too big
LOL uhh
or respond super curtly
until he gets bored of the Convo
Like I feel bad but like...he wasn't very nice in person
just ignore it
hmm
so you def don't want to see him again
there's a few things you could do
or tell him hey was good meeting you but I don't think this is gonna work out etc
I would personally do one or two
Ughhhhh
And got two texts
I fucked up
I responded one line
what he say
:(
Maybe I shouldn't have haha'd
it would be better if you just stopped responding
id get the message and move on
at this point
honestly as a guy
Man I feel so bad
he might text something again some time but if you just ignore it again he'd just move on
Ok
on one hand thats more polite thing to do
Idkkkk
im not sure actually
but on the other hand it feels kinda presumptuous to "break up" with someone you jsut met
Just be like "hey, I don't think this will work out. Sorry"?
no
well hmm
But I think you're right
Should I say smth though?
id be a bit annoyed for a little bit but then get over it pretty quick
I just don't understand what happened
Oh really?
like if you saw him 2 or 3 times
like as much as i hate ghosting i think its honestly the best move after a first date
then yeah def say something instead of just disappearing
Really? Ah ok
or something
thats just for me
i think personally
if i went on a date iwth a girl and thought it went ok
and then the conversation just died and she stopped responding
LOL
Man I suck
maybe he was really bad at reading you
or you acted too nice despite not liking it
hahahahhaa
and he misread
Like I thought things went POORLY
or hes just hopelessly optimistic
And that it was mutual
iunno
he couuld be compensating though
There's no way right? Like people aren't actually like that
They're just awkward and bad at communicating right?
seems like he just has a ego problem though
everything he does seems to suggest giant ego
For what. It was date 1....
so maybe he just refuses to admit defeat
like raed too many advdice thats like "even if you think its not going well just be confident and assertive and it could work!"
which makes sense to a point
Like. I don't think it would've been that bad if he wasn't so rude right up front
yeah who says that
im so confused
LOL
Like opening with "oh yeah drinks here suck"
üòÇ Haha
wait
that bottle just lied to you
did you pay it $10?
damn
thats steep
$15 actually
do you like camping
Also - I am hiring movers for today, so thank you for your help, but I think I will be good!
I had too many heavy boxes
Nah. But i do like some people more than I hate camping.
LOL
ok
how mcuh were movers
ooo
Idk like $60 tentatively üòû
But it saves hassle I gues
oh no :(
do you have a ton of boxes still
Yeah üò¢
Yosemite is so intense lol
LOL
just chill in the tent all day
you dont have to hike
üôå
Lol look at this PSA from Bumble
LOL
that funny
are you hydrated?
drink more water then
ooooo
Not on bumble lol
Ok mom
LOL
ughh
invisalign is annoying me
my teeth are sore >:(
Man I can't do it but change our group emoji to that
üò¨
Or do you say "I can't swing that"
Date
i think it's fair to say
But you are too poor for sushi rn
What's the etiquette
Btw if a guy asks you to a sushi dinner
is it a date?
Yas
or just a friend wanting to hang out
üò¨
Do you have to pay still?
Can you just run my tinder for me
hahaha
then he can either suggest something cheaper or offer to pay
only if you run my tinder for me
i love sushi but im trying to save money right now so dont think i can afford to eat that
im actually curious how much better you'd perform by letting a friend of your target gender run it
Cool.
I want to do that
I think I'm an above average flirter
So we'd have to run a test with two people who we feel have similar flirting capabilities
Omg. That would be such a fun experiment.
LOL
I think I kind of ugly duckling'd
we need to establish a standardized test
Omg yes
#justkatherinethings
and then you can send them some market research afterwards
How to determine flirting capability?
are you really an above average flirter
and aggregate the data
Self assessment?
Idk. I think so.
when was this?
High school
were you bad at flirting before?
So I dated even when guys actively told me I was ugly
So I think I'm good at flirting then
??
Lol
wat
I have multiple data points confirming my unattractiveness
was this texas?
California and China lol
maybe i should move to texas if you are considered ugly there
oh
i thought that every single girl i saw was super ugly
when i visited china
Well. Southern Chinese girls are prettier üòâ
But lol nah I went to international school.
what did you look like back in hs
LOL
So Korean, Chinese and American guys have all told me I'm ugly
üò¨
i didnt know people actually ugly duckling
Lol this is a pretty bad one
But like lol. I still dated guys.
looooool
ok
i believe you now
LOL
what happened
how uh
are you actually just a diff person
who stole the original katherine's identity
who are you really ‡≤†_‡≤†
why are you pretty now
LOL
identity thief!
I think I don't look that different lol. But acne is rough
i bet you have a little red book
or maybe you are a spy
you are a chiense spy
I lost my baby fat, fixed my skin a little, that's it actually lol
thats what a spy would say ‡≤†_‡≤†
lol it's not that different!
But yeah. So that's why I think I'm a good flirter
you dont need it anymore
but maybe you are out of practice
Hm. Idk.
i still wouldnt want to talk to her
id just be like "oh no she likes me, what do i do"
also iunno if being good at flirting helps that much
i feel like if a girl i wasnt interested in was good at flirting
LOL
"like just a little"
I think I have game. Like just a little
Well idk.
Oh
Lol. If I really had game
I would be able to salvage a bad situation
But I get really nervous around certain guys
Like only like 2 guys I think
but not always in a good way
if i really like someone i get less shy
Do you get nervous?
actually no
it's interesting
Like you know when you build someone up in your head - then I'm like die
But otherwise I'm good.
;)
not in a creepy way
i can get a bit obsessed
Oh same. But I'm also shy.
and also how much i want it
haha interesting
for me it's how much they show interest back
the more they show the less shy i get
i mean thats obvious haha
also i think depends on how well i know them
yeah
but if i really want it
i am ready to take the risk
That makes sense
if i only kinda want it i usually am scared to try too hard
Hmm I never know people I have a crush on very well
oh yeah but like
I'm like obnoxiously loud and whatever about things
Oh like people I'm really close to, I don't try to look cute or act cute
yeah for me it's the opposite
Maybe it's bc I hobo around my friends a lot
hobo around?
what mean
just that i tend to not feel anything for someone until i get to become friends with them
College sweetheart
Do itttt
hahahahahahahaha
that affects whether they have a crush about you
i end up falling in love with someone ive known for years
That's a good story tho
not the other way around
Maybe. Idk.
oh for me i dont mean
who should i fall in love with?
But I kind of have the feeling that everyone is in love with Felby. She's so cute
Camille is pretty
Oh Felby
But actually no. I like having her as a friend
Camille.
Or that other girl
im not
i like having her as a friend
is everyone in love with felby?
LOL
waht other girl
Idk I would be. She's so nice :3
That other one
I forget her name
Dude Camille then
tell :O
click on the guest list
https://www.facebook.com/events/117146575548458/
LOl
what other one
Ah! Yvana
LOL
yeah i am
Picky.
so are you tho
ah hahaha
nah
I feel like I've rejected a lot of guys for that reason.
Personality wise yeah
Like super super picky lol.
once you pass a threshold i dont care anymore
and then personality matters a ton
but
for me it's like
looks matters a lot
hahaha
ive rejected a ton of girls for that too
but also for not being good looking enough
but i dont admit that
LOL
once you are good looking enough, any more doesnt matter that much
most guys i know are like
why dont you date that  girl
whereas im like
a lot of people are kinda boring
lol that's like a lot of guys
and dont have a lot to talk about
acutally i feel like its not
shes SO hot
and im like yeah but shes not interesting to talk to and has no hobbies
and they are like yea normally i would mind but SO HOT tho
what would you say is the number 1 personality thing you look for
prob like being nice right
considerate and thoughtful etc
Yeah. But like, I think I have higher standards for that.
Like. I want someone with a far better personality than me. Who I can admire as a person lol.
And like, they might think they've like made it already by then.
Like I feel bad, bc when I'm into a guy, it's SUPER OBVI. Like I straight up ask stupid stuff like "are you single" or ask them out. And then I come to my senses
And realize they're not up to my niceness standard.
But you know those things about someone only after a some time.
hahahahaha
so what makes you fall for a guy to begin with
then you get a crush
but then he might not end up actually being as good a person as you hoped
And if he seems kind and we share a sense of humor
hahahahaha
so looks first
Idk. Like if I think he's cute. But apparently that's arbitrary according to my friends
Well like, my ex, we hit it off bc our humor just like melted together
ya I think that's important for me too
But people weren't always nice about how he looked, but I thought he was like the most attractive guy ever
i mean i might find them attractive
Well there's either tension or there's not
Yah
which is unfortunate for me because i dont work that way at all
i never feel anything about anyone i just met
Usually though I know like within meeting a person for the first time if I'm going to crush on them or not lol
Bc I'm a middle schooler
i feel like i heard a lot of girls say that
Ah.
i mean unless the yare just super hot and im intimidated
and i dont feel that way about anyone i just met
or at most i think
but it usually takes many times hanging out with them before i develop emotions
"ok this person is pretty cool i wouldnt mind getting to know them more"
But like when you think about "which girls do I not want to trip and fall in front of"
i dont really want to trip and fall in front of anyone
LOL
im being pedantic i know your point
i think chemistry is really important to me
some people i just mesh really well with and always have stuff to talk about
and i think the humor thing also is important
but being intimidated isnt the same thing as liking them
i wont ever get a crush on someone im intimidated by
some people we can just bounce jokes off each other all day
Yeah...that's hard though.
It's mostly like polite humor haha
Humor is nice but it's hard to find lol.
Like I don't think there's anyone in SF even platonically I've met where it's been like with my ex.
which ex
calvin?
or one of your previous ones i havent met
what is polite humor
I saw him again for the 4th. It was rough
you told me about him
oh yeah
i remember
Yeah. Lol.
Oh no lol.
There's an ex. Like THE ex, you know?
ugh im hungry but too lazy to take off the invisalign
at this rate i might end up getting in shape
how long has it been since you were together
:(
It's been 2+ years
But man. I still cry at songs bc of him lol.
When did you get the Invisalign? Recently?
aww :(
Oh wow
But your teeth weren't bad were they?
i got it yesterday
if you cry too much you might get dehydrated
you need to stay hydrated
thanks for not noticing!
nah they are horrible
Oh really? Yeah no idea
üò¨
Just 10? EZ GAEM EZ LIFE
if you cant name at least 10 ways i suck you will fail
thanks
you will be quizzed on this
please pay more attention to my flaws
nono you have to also convince me that they are flaws
Lol
Man.
Nervous.
I was thinking of maybe doing it next week. Or next next week. But idk.
Should I ask that guy out?
nothings gonna change
also im actually kinda surprised
hahaha
you should just do it and get it over with
either hes down or he isnt
but i never saw him as significantly nicer than the average person
i agree hes good looking
Why would I be nervous for some tinder guy
What?
are we talking about chris
wait actually
or some tinder guy
lol the former
kk
im surprsied cuz
I've been hung out with him
but like
i dont see him as like a super great personality that you can be inspired by
but i thought you were looking for some moral pariah
This is how I know hype men work
i like him hes smart and funny
im saying
Ahhhh don't hype him.
sure hes decent looking
Allan keeps hyping him.
no im not hyping him
Lol well I don't know him
im actually doing the opposite
Allan hyped the nice part
Are drinks too forward?
Yeah. I guess that's what I want to see.
he just seems like any other dude
i havent seen any nice things he does
he seems normal
I've never been on a day thing before so idk how coffee dates work
drinks could be fine
i think allan is just hyping him
LOL im not saying hes a dick
just that like
i dont know any firends who are dicks
Lol
hes nice enough for me to consider a friend
well maybe myself
How do I got about it?
"ayyy bbby wnt sum fuk???"
I already did that
Didn't work
"are you single"
thats more
"ayyy bby wnt sum d8?"
no you said
i bet hed want to date a korean
but thats just my feeling
iunno just ask him to drinks i think it's fine
so maybe he doesnt care
But like I have this false hope bc we talked a long time ago
but like he dated white girls before
Yeah I know right. I think he would tio
he's either interested or isnt
You're right
K. Next week.
I should just do it and get it over with
oh vlejfhaiksnfb! i've visited there in iceland!
Yeah also it super sucks bc I have the feeling he's not nice actually
But vlejfhaiksnfb
hahaia i meant for you
Wow
like misbalanced crushes generally doesnt work very well
i mean obsession isn't healthy anyway
No it's ok. I'm probably being creepy.
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
k do it
er not obsession
Lol
sorry STRONG word
either helikes you and it works out well
or he doesnt or turns out to be not what you imagined
either way its better to just find out quick and get it over with
Ok ty love coach
Yeah true.
np
üò¨
hahaha
Lolllll so rudddee
I get ittttt
so you can track how nice he is
I uglyyyyy
wait
why dont you just plant your spy cameras around him
I don't need spy cam
I need hype men
no if you were still ugly now you wouldnt be a spy would you
For me
I need a hype crew
But people don't help me. They sabotage me. Like Allan.
rude allan
V v v rude
so rude
Ok. No more. Zip.
Are you free tomorrow btw?

Ah ok
wtf i picked up
Your phone zzzz
iunno whats going onnn
ugh why is it not working
???
i literally drew the same exact person when i was taking art in middle school
for a second i thought "holy crap how did they get a photo of my drawing on their website"
http://yiyanartacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/0011.jpg
and they had example drawings from their students on the website
and i saw this
this is so freaky
i was looking up art classes
and came across one
Me too
üò¨
They're on their way btw
Pic?
Whyyy
Rude
Lol what
it's not me! it's the phone
Someone said you guys were talking about me at Uber.
Is that true?
Hey. I heard some shit
???
I don't work at Uber anymore
It must've been at your dinner
When you visited
o like  last week?
let me think
I don't remember anyone saying anything
And we just fought about it right now
üòï ok.
what did you hear?
I just want to make sure it's just like joking because Calvin overhead you guys
connie said you were cute and that we should date you but she says that about almost every girl LOL
And he made it seem like a LOT of people I knew, knew
connie asked me about my Seattle date and then I talked about that and then asked about ari breaking up with Jenny
I think it was the part that connie said you were cute
we both talked
whaaat
It's just kind of shitty because he made it seem like y'all were being super loud about it
so we were talking about girls and dating life
and then Connie's like o Katherine's single now  she's super cute why don't one of you date her
or something like that
and I think I said something like connie you say that about every girl
oh...
Idk.
and then Serge said yo Calvin's right there
and connie stopped talking
üòï I guess I'm just upset because he made it out to be like something else
What
ok I wouldn't tell any of my friends they should date each other
I wouldn't tell Chris that he should date you
connie just says that about everyone
No like you guys wouldn't have talked about someone being interested in me, or whatever
Y'all wouldn't have said anything like that if Chris was around right?
Or about me even, if he was around?
haha I wasn't talking about you at all
connie just mentioned it and I said no chill
it wasn't even a discussion
Oh. But he wasn't there, right?
hmm
connie: "why dont one of you date her??"
me: "LOL you say that about every girl"
but like
even if he was
all he woulda heard woulda been
I don't quite remember if he was
I don't think so though
Ok.
Yeah, I mean it's not only that I guess
I'm just kind of stressed out since Calvin made it seem like something more intense than Connie joking
ya
0 effects on your reputation to chris
it literally woulda been 0 information about you
Ok.
just connie being playful as per usual
Yeah...
like if she was seriously suggesting it
and honestly if there was i woulda shut it down anyway
I just don't want to be put in an awk spot where I can't be friends with people
i dont remember there being any thing else
Bc there's stupid shit going on that I don't know about
i woulda told her yo no
what if you dated ryan
I'm sorry. It's just what Calvin said made it seem like several of his coworkers were talking about me dating
I guess he said Allan and Alex said similar things
and you go dude chill
wtf really
Yeah..:
we werent even talking about you
it was more about me and ari
and like potential dates for us
the equivalent to me going
how was your date today?
oh it was bad?
i couldnt hear their conversation
Ah ok.
yeah
Ok. Yeah sorry. I don't want it to be a big deal if it isn't.
i dont know what allan and alex were talking about tho
and then i dropped it
they sat on the far side of hte table
we had like more than 10 people there
and thats all
like gossiping about your dating life?
Please don't tell anyone that I heard anything from Calvin
ok for sure
no its totally fine
i wont
Man. Sorry to like
I'm just being like nervous
Bring this up to you
what were you afraid the conversation was about?
robin and jacq tried doing that with me
oh like
oh wtf
Because it's so nice hanging out with everyone.
Which is just a gross feeling...
i actually hate that
That, or that someone was "going after me" which made me feel just really awful.
people wre all scheming to help someone get you
But Calvin kind of made it seem like people were only hanging out with me to
Yeah basically set me up with someone
Sorry.
no dont be
yeah
Did you pass your interview?
and i didnt like it
Yeah.
Ughhhhh
like yo if i liked someone i can ask them out
why needa plot something
Yeah. It made me super sad honestly to think about.
thats so weird
Yeah it's most just...thinking that people don't genuinely want me to be around, except to get with someone they know
setting people up is just so dumb
we're all adults why gotta make things awkward like that
you're right to be upset if thats what you thought was going on
i wouldnt ever plot to helpsomeone get someone
the most id do is give dating advice
Which is dumb when I type it I guess, but that's kind of what I was thinking
i invite you to things because you're fun to hang out with
yeah absolutely not
and ya I passed the interview
iys not really an interview
they just do some paperwork and then approve you
Oh that's good.
ya haha
wait fuck k
ignore that sticker
I was trying to type and clicked the sticker LOL
what did you end up getting for food
messenger app been so buggy lately
he's gonna develope codependency at this rate
it's not healthy
I feel like you should just say no
Yeah. I probably should have
Calvin came over bc he wanted to help me unpack
And we UberEATS'd
I just feel bad for him
And then fought
Idk.
ya but it's not just for you
it's better for him too
rip off the bandaid
ask him tomorrow
*better
do it!
Ugh. This week. Has just been the shittiest ever.
I might as well be ballsy this week so all the suck happens and next week can be betters
or take 5 shots and do it right now ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
LOl jk
Ughhh
the two of them dont work on the same org
Previously
oh i see
uber is a huge company
dont worry!!!
So.
Allan told me he doesn't want to make things troublesome at work
why would it make things troublesome
Bc Calvin
allan needs to stop telling you things
But idk, if it seems like, I am also being like an uber slut SOMEHOW. Idk.
LOL
i mean
you just happen to know a lot of uber people
nothing wrong with that
Ugh
its ok
stop doubting it!
Mk. Sorry I feel like I bombarded you with messages today.
and im not just saying that
Good night

no reason to be!!
fb won't let me set it for 8:17
Help me with wording
and ill see if it works
okok draft up something first
not yet
i mean i sent that message at like 1230
she might not have opened the app yet since then
Did that girl respond btw?
o let me see
Yeah
haha
lool jk
if she doesnt respond im blaming you
if he doesnt respond ill message him and ask him to respond
If he doesn't respond I'm blaming you
hmm
"yo chris can you respond to kath please thanks"
we can always try blackmail too
force him to love you
^literally me
Lollllll
üò¨
what if that works?
lol by this conversation, I already know he won't say yes
Guys can feel creeper vibes from like 100 miles away
he wont see it coming
What
he can fool him by having me be the creeper in your stead
but
it will catch him off guard
What if he says yes
like ill message him and ask him out
he wont see it coming
like on my account
as me
fuck
"hey chris im gay for you will you go out with me?"
and then you ask him while he's confused
will you be jealous?
I'll cut my hair and wear your jacket
Kason
it will confuse him
oh thats a great idea
but with luck he'll go with it
you need to be more tan
And go in your stead as "Kason"
The internet says I should strike up a convo first
But idk
I'm too nervous for that
"Hey - would you want to go grab drinks with me sometime?"
so its not too out of teh blue
and then go do you want to grab drinkssometime?
just be like
hey how have you been or something
like a couple lines of smalltalk
ok i think thats a little weird
i think you shouldnt make it like the first line
but dont have to strike up a whole convo first
i think
Omg but what's small talk?
iunno actually
Fuck
dpeends on how responsive he is
you can literally juts be like
hey havent talked in a while!
Duck.
how have you been? do you still play league
or osmething iunno
something generic
just to establish rapport
and then ask
Omg that's so awk
whyyy
ok just ask straight up then
Omg helpppp
oh hey chris! hows it going
do you want to grab drinks sometime?
maybe just be like
I need a professional
hey chris! hows it going
Oh hey?
dont say oh hey
you dont need a professional
Is that awk?
press send
then type the second one and press send
no as in
dont wait for a response in between
What if he flat out is like "hey, what's up"
O
type the first one
say those 2 messages in one go
I'm dying.
Where is your date tonight?
local edition
going at 830
dont die
just doo
Like
Hey Chris, how's it going?
Fuck that's so bad
I'm like embarrassed reading that
hmm
Hey - so sorry this is a little out of the blue, but do you want to grab drinks with me sometime?
üò¨
assume its not awkward and it wont be awkward
just be straightforward
nooo dont apologize
*third
That's not a truth
I need a second opinion
ok fine
but assume its awkward and it will be awkward
the most you try to assuage the awkwardness the weirder it gets
"So I just saw (insert random coincidental thing here) which made me think of you and that one time (insert sneaky relevant story here). I'd like to catch up! Do you want to grab a coffee or lunch sometime?"
My friends advice
iif I got that from a girl I'd be inclined not to
well actually it depends on what the story is
that's weird
but it's a bit creepy
like why are you thinkingabout me
hmm
UGH
Then what do I say
ayy bby wnt sum fuk
?????
I feel like that's awk tho
I mean. He 100% knows I'm awk
cuz it's desperate
ya so just keep t simple
to be like I really want to get to know you
thats so awk
I feel like any way I do this will be awk
like you shouldn't show too much interest like that
Maybe I should just own up to my awkness
Why?
I'd be like wat are you in love with me???
??? This then?!
LOL
Oops I didn't crop
aknowledge makes it more awk
that accomplishes nothing
and even if he didn't find it weird with that line it draw attention to the fact that you thought it was weird
why say hey this is out of the blue
Bc it's acknowledging how awk I'm being
why not just ask
but why
Lol
well I can't speak for Chris
hold up let me find a ss
iwould def prefer without the acknowledgement of awk
Look at that
so maybe Julia's idea would be good
cuz I wouldn't find t awk if you just asked
do it
but I know for me personally
Perfect text
LOL
Ss?
What
Why lol
lololol
I'd be weary
no don't
I mean you can
but I'd hate that if I was Chris and someone sent that
ok send the Pusheen kissing emoji
Omg LOL
no she was referring to my other text
The "out of the blue" one
LOOL
either way it's about the same
if he's down its not going to make a diff
and afraid she's too in love with me
it's not that bad actually
actually no
What lol
I just think it's better without the hey this is out of the blue
but actually now that I think about it
it still isn't gonna make a diff
just do it
üò¨
and if he isn't
I hate myself
Ty for your support
wait why
don't worry about it
he will say yes
we can always try blackmail
Hey, how've you been? It's been a while. I was wondering if you wanted to grab a drink some time and catch up.
yup!!!
perfect
üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå
im already falling in love just by seeing that message
LOL sorry
I actually think it'd great
you should send this one
Now you're being sarcastic
can you send it again
Omg you troll
Is it actually ok
omg pls
üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
I need to see it again
serious:
it's my fave one yet
Ok.
I asked my coworker
She's so smooth
do it
wait but this message is almost literally what i told you originally
And my coworkers said after 8 is slutty lol
So 7:53?
No it's more eloquent
LOL omg

No people keep calling me
What do girls usually wear on dates w you?
I wonder what I should wear to Yamo. Normally probably like a t shirt and jeans lol.
hmm iunno
but like a little more dressy
Lol
you should fake an injury
and it will be all romantic
usually casual stuff
iunno
What kind of shoes
and then he will save you
LOL
just doctor things
But what if he finds out
dang
Like I'm faking something and he's like "actually...you have a tumor"
And I'm like wat
well better find out now than too late
should be a real injury
oh
well shit
True.
What shoes do they normally wear
iunno
hahaha
just wear based off the vibe of the place
depends on what we doing i guess
i dont think guys care that much
Yeah
Hey are you and Ryan actually up to help me with curtains? I can buy you guys food. My task rabbits keep canceling üò¢
yeah im totally down
its not that difficult
i already offered
next week?
Mm I was actually wondering if you guys were free sometime tomorrow or Sunday
If not, Monday night?
tomorrow might be hard
afternoon maybe
but sunday should work
Yeah that would be perfect!!!
I'll ask Ryan too
wait
just ask in the group chat we have
I asked him indiv
Oh
so we can coordinate together a time that works
I didnt know we had a group chat
well we do >:(
üò¨
üò¨
üò¨
what doing
when is date
7:30
Getting ready now lol
I can't find any of my stuff
o no
come hang out
lol I can't. Showering and stuff
üò¨
true
üò¨
now what
üò¨
how is
How to make move
Idk if he wants make move but I want
hmm
What're you up to?
Man. It ended so weird.
oo how?
Nothing happened in the end. We like. Took a Lyft together, it dropped me off and that was it
But I thought it went really well...
oh what's confusing then
Idk. Shouldn't have something happened?
But then we went to a bar.
Idk.
I mean nothijg had to have happened
Oh really?
Like I don't think he tried to make any moves. But he could've ended the date at a point
oh I see
ya maybe
it's just a first date
Ohhh
I mean it could mean a few things
could just be he didn't feel like making a move cuz is only first date
or maybe he wasn't feeling it
Yeah. I'm like not sure I'll ever see him again.
But it sucks lol. I liked him.
sent?
but did enjoy hanging out
oh I see hmm
He sent
Like super vague.
And he doesn't really text me, so. Idk. It was a super awk ending
why would he say that if he didn't want to see you again
Bc it's polite and he seems nice
that seems like he is sorta interested at least
I wouldn't if I didn't
but you don't have to make false plans to be polite
just say I had a great time good night
I know
just didn't know a better phrase to describe it
I don't think that's making a plan
I always say "yeah let's hang sometime"
As a vague "maybe we will or won't"
Blahhhhhh
ya maybe
Idk. Can just tell he is.
He was so nice.
how was he nice
I mean it wouldn't have worked bc he's a doctor
maybe he just had good manners
doesn't mean he's actually a nice person
Yeah maybe.
Yeah maybe I'm being bamboozled
and vice versa
some people talk like dicks but are actually super kind underneath
Idk. I think he seemed like he cared a lot about people.
Ok. Oh well.
hahaha
well I'm not saying he isn't
just maybe it's too early to tell
also you still don't know if he's not interested!
I don't get it
are you just surprised he didn't try to take you home?
LOL no not that
But like idk lol. I thought that a first date kiss would be nice.
But maybe I have no idea how dates should go
I think it's the latter
Should I text to check up? Or no?
What's the cool thing to do
ohhhh I see what you mean
maybe he's shy tho
and didn't want to make a move too early
don't text just yet id say
but do text him sometime today if he doesn't text you
I would just strike up a Convo about something interesting you saw or something
at least I would
but iunno
üò¨
haha this isnt all my experience
Ty for the advice...your experience is so valuable
its also just what i would want as a guy
but i dont know if i can speak for every guy
so get second opinions if any thing i say doesnt make sense
I think most of the things you say make sense
aww yaya
yay*
i think you know too but you just get nervous hahaha
and then get confused
I guess usually I just do whatever I want. But now in the adult world, it's not as cute to be that clingy
are you relaly clingy?
Haha kind of unfortunately.
Trying not to be.
do something about a crush before it developes too strong
hahahahahaha
i get like that too when i really like someone
which is wshy i think you should just
I think it's just I like talking and being around people a LOT. So. I think it's misconstrued as I'm obsessed with someone
by then it gets a lot harder
Wait what do you mean
ahh yeah
i have that problem too sometime
the other guy situation
thats why i told you to ask him out asak
Ohhh
Jason you too smart
and then it gets harder to act smart around him
Do something about it
oh like
??
asap
Yeah.
before your cursh developes too hard
That makes sense
actually i totally relate with the
that it can come off as obsessive
Haha yeah?
like i meet someone really cool
I like that you seem pretty open with everything though
i tend to be pretty down and also pretty open about myself
wanting to spend time with people a lot
i do that sometimes too
even with people i just wanna be friensd with
and ill keep asking them to hang out
haha yeah
no real poitn being mysterious
and only want to hang out with their close friends
and i think
so i keep asking them to go to things
I'm glad we have that in common lol.
some people are like really closed off
and sometimes i meet them
man i wanna hang out with them too
ya
i dont like that
why be cliquey
but they like rarely ever agree
Bc y'all have a lot of HS friends or college friends?
I hang out with anyone
LOL.
Aren't you are Ryan like that though?
I'm not cliquey tho
they just don't always come
and I invite random people I just met to my things all the time
Ah
i like that
some people are always just
ya
some people I meet are like super down to make new friends
ohh no im hanging out with other people
ya Sam
I don't know how to interact with introverts
LOL
same
Yeah I like the more socially open people
üò¨

>.>

oh hey so for thursday hows this time and this place?
then just go with it
but if hgoes oh wait theres an allan thing
i guess just bring it up

Like be like "hey - Allan is hosting a goodbye thing?"
like
like
and if he says sure
Mk.
then you can discus
Ffffffff
But like. Idk when to reschedule it to.
Isn't it?
iunno
friday i mean
üò¨
Ok.
Friday is way too commitment
And idk
could be ok
üò¨
üò¨
hahaha one day
I still don't have the wave feature...
Gym today?
so ryan and i have singing class at 830 to 930
we can go around 10?
okk
Omg singing class thooooo
looool
SINGING CLASS?! :0
And that's fine. I have class until 9 lol
Yalls karaoke game will be so on point
well im really bad at singing
That's so fun! I wish I could sing more
so im trying to get to a point where im just ok
looool
But I feel self conscious bc sf apartment walls are so thin
wear a mask so no one can tell who you are
LOL
ooo
just sing on the balcony
#subtle
Ok I expect a performance from you two soon
will be a while
maybe in 5 years
nooo
still bad
one day
üòû
its ok
i emailed some art class but they never responded
rude
I'm out of practice but I used to be in art education :3
i want to get back into drawing for reals
whyyy
Ooh! I can help and practice with you.
okokok
how help
oooo!!!
how?
Well I guess it depends on the kind of art you want to pursue
I am pretty savvy (I guess more than avg person) in sketching I think .
Just practice lol.
get a tablet and draw shit
Ohhhh
sketching is pretty much all I learned
I wanna learn digital art
how?
Really old solid intuos
I used photoshop for digital
I can help with that too haha.
oo!!!
Though Allan has a Wacom he can sell you
what i really want is a tablet with a screen
so i returned it
oh
i have a wacom bamboo
i bought one a while back but it wasnt very good
i dont think just drawing random things is a good way to improve
like when i was younger and i took art classes teacher didnt just make us draw things nonstop
heres how to hold the pencil, ok now draw a line that doesnt have any hooks 10000 times
draw 50000 circles
also how should i practice
well its not a bad way but just not the most efficient
showed us specific techniques and drills and stuff
etc
But I think the most important thing is consistently drawing
Ah I did that. I do think it's helpful.
but like
most important part is to just go to the gym
its still important to get the form right
otherwise you're not practicing efficiently
oh yeah for sure
its like working out
but once youve establised that
Yah
what did you do for art education
Trained in a lot of mediums.
yeah
when was this
!!
College. I was almost an art education major lol
didnt know that
so you are much artiste
what other mediums did you do
what!!!!
cool!
üò¨
Ahh I can do acrylic paint a bit from training, but I also do chalk pastel.
I am shit at watercolors
I can also do paper models/balsa models
And a bit of welding/woodworking
wait you do woodworking!
omg
and it was really fun
haha
i did some back in middle school
Yeah since I was an architecture major and then I did a semester of 3D space sculpturing when I moved to art
I want to see middle school jason

>:(
lol it's kind of specific
I'm looking for user research roles or measurement analytics
"ey bby im looking to do some user research and measurements ;)"
will you be my research subject?
hmm
maybe you should tell this to your doctor friend
You're a smooth criminal jason
Lol so smooth
Btw do you know anyone else with a car?
yeah i do
what do you need?
hmm
a few people
A coffee table and side table
Should be quick
It's soma to soma so not far
But I need help moving
i feel like youd need a pickup truck
a coffee table prob wont fit in a normal car would it?
or did you buy it and need to pick it up
are you moving it from your old place to ava?
I need it pick up
Obviously can't be a tiny car like yours tho
Idk she says it's light
the doors arent big enough usually
üòû
yeah but i feel like even a sedan wont work
for a whole table
Oh really?
robin has a discount code for getaround
Hmm, I feel like a van could fit it though.
Do you think I can uber XL it?
let me see if getaround has any pickup trucks
40% off
cuz minivans have sliding doors
how much was lugg per hour?
ooo good idea!
that could work
oh :(
Yah
hmm
Too expensive
And I think they cheated me
sad
hmm do i know anyone with a minivan?
everyone in sf either has no car or a small one
*sense
i think some of my southbay friends might
LOL
dang i dont think so
That makes sens
yeah
but i doubt theyd drive up to sf
She said they can fit in a smart car
thats tiny!
what!!!
one of my friends that im hanging out with tomorrow has a car and he lives like across the street from ava
let me see if he can help
ok let me see who has a sedan
when do you need it moved by?
im messaging my friends with cars rn
Lol this weekend
gotcha
!!!! Really?
:D
vegas lool
for a bday party
i wont be around on the weekend but if they are down i can set up sometime for yall to meet
You're the best
Where are you going?
btw when are you going home from work today?
Wanna muni?
Oh why
i have meeting until 530
any time after that is ok
oh yeah if we are going back at same time
Like maybe 6:30? I have to pick up a purse from Ian at 6:50
o wait I gotta go pick up malaria pills
I probably won't leave until after 6
I'll meet you at ava for curtains
hmm maybe let's just leave separately then haha
Mk
so don't want you to wait for me to do that anyway
Wait what time do you want to leave
o I gotta go get my malaria pills
I don't mind
Are you sure?
it's just a 10 min long muni ride
haha ya it should be fine
üò¨
üò¨
hmm let me see who else has
dang their cars are in South bay
I'm home now message when you are back
Ok!
I might be like 5 mins late
*guys
message my hush
I'm picking up something from my friend at 6:50 so
I'll msg you hush
LOL
oh good it's not 7 yet
fuck
I was reading on my bed and fell asleep
716 right?
open door
just go to sacramento instead
LOL
wait
better solution than adhesive
LOL
because it is the day i have to pay my credit card bills
i never look at my spending all month
Lol...
I feel so bad too because you guys worked so hard on this
nahhh dont worry
ugh today is a bad day
I'm so sorry üò¢
and then the day i have to pay i cry
LOL
omg i spent like $300 on ubereats wtfff
not anymore!
OHHHHHHH
LOOOOL
lol don't you have credits?
i dont work there anymore rmemeber
ah crap
LOL
LOL
Are you going to that?
theres no dinner at work tomorrow
because theres an intern event happening
as in it's going to take up the whole office space
no LOL
Do you wanna grab dinner? Maybe with Albert too?
ill ask albert too
but hes not going to allans thing is he?
so they are telling us to go home by 6 tomorrow
Lol... welp
yeah lets get dinner
Oh true
But if it will be awk we can just go eat
Idk I guess it's up to you. We can all eat and split and let him know
i mean its an uber party it makes sense he isn't going
ill ask
Oh yeahhh
its fine haha not awk ill ask him
but he sprained his ankle and is working from home today so he might not be here tomo either
how was date
0 connection.
Waste of money. Spent $32
I am never offering to buy the first drinks again
Waste of time
Talked a lot about spaghetti
hahaha
alsol lol! spaghetti
what!! why should you buy the first drinks
dont do that
I'd actually prefer to just split and venmo
Idk. I just want to be nice.
hmm
But it's been awk to do it in the past
im glad you think that way
I don't want a guy to always pay bc then it feels like I owe him or smth
*i do
My guilt is greater than my sadness at the money loss
this time you paid
and you still didnt get a good date out of it
but i dont think you should feel like you owe him
Yeah....but I did
ahaha
but look at it the opposite way
But yeah that sucked last night. I def ended it at the first chance I saw
what you could do is just take turns
makes it fair
i think splitting is a good way
you can buy the first round half the time
But I think the second round drinks were cheaper
Idk.
Yeah we took turns
I think I'll just be like "oh no worries, I'll get my own"
I wonder how I should handle payment tonight
one of the previous or just a new one
who is today?
Chris lol
Which I'm like strangely not as nervous about anymore
Like...I like the other guy a lot lol
Take turns?
wait
are you getting drinks?
yeah you dont have to offer first
the guy usually will offer to buy the first round
oh!!
i htink you should just take turns
you dont wanna come off as penny pinching
just dont buy super expensive drinks if it your turn to buy
Should I offer first then and close out
Yeah
Why
Mk. What if he doesn't think it's a date thing
you just buy rounds
so you dont have to both get up and wait in line
and then you just take turns
thats how id do drinks anyway at a bar
Mk.
pretty casual
simple shirt and a skirt
What kind of shoes
I have an outfit in mind but I don't want to seem too try hard
where are you going?
How did your date dress to local edition
How casual
Simple shirt

https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6mwtdr/poster_on_rrelationships_claims_his_coworker_that/?st=J5TXQYYX&sh=49409d1e
holy shit
That's scary üòû
Holy shit dude
Do you browse /r/relationships?
I feel like that sub is depressing
Btw this was my first super like match on Tinder
2' 01" what a big cat
omgg
cheezit
i dont browse /r/relationships yeah its kinda sad there
omg
more pics
This is the best profile of my life
I've found the one
I should just delete all my other dating apps
omg
so cute
if you finally get a cat will you change your name to catherine
yeah why need anything else once you have cat
I hope I don't scare them off
hahahahhahahaha
whats their message in response to?
the original message
Oh lol. My profile
i want that pineapple drink
:(
I'm so sad you're gone this Friday
I want to go get drinks. This week has sucked so hard and it's only Monday
aww whats wrong
*Tuesday
aww :(
but pagan idol is fun
you should check that out
Yah
not alocholic
most people can drink way more than you LOL
Just stuff. Like almost 70% bc of work. But then fighting with calvin, moving stuff, dating stuff.
I want to go to a tiki bar
lets go when im back
But akis thing is sat so I feel like an alcoholic if I ask anyone this week
whaat
no
üòï
Bc of my rent deposit
And I took a vacuum cleaner
:(
sad
why are you still fighting with calvin
oh
Whatever.
*our
It's dumb
so its def not about this
About what
??
oops i meant
i dont think its about the vacuum cleaner then
just emotions
Yeah it's like I don't care anymore and I don't want to discuss out "relationship"
thats why you dont talk to your ex for a while
before trying to be friends
oh is that what he says
yeah
But he wants to keep bringing shit up and it just pisses me off
to get over them
but hes had break ups before
he should know that this is what always happens
Yeah he brings it up over things like me taking the vacuum and me wanting my rent deposit
why is he trying to get you to drag him down
Yeah but idk I think the relationship is more important to him
thats exactly why you shouldnt talk for a while
Idk.
Yeah you're right
For me, it ended so long ago and there are just all these bad feelings
dont most people learn this in highschool
I feel really shitty for not caring that he's sad
you def dont try to talk to them while youre still sad about it
if you break up with someone you still care a lot about
But I'm just so bitter about the relationship
thats how you make sure you lose a friend permanently
Yeah.
you shouldnt have to feel bad about this
that actually makes me pretty upset
aww
hes not being a good person by doing this
and is trying to drag you down by guilt tripping you
hes refusing to have the emotional maturity to move on
that stuff happens in highschool with breakups
but most people learn by now
It's my fault bc I think I sucker people into these relationships
Idk if his past relationships were like this
Like we dated over a year and a half
And that's sometimes a deal to people
But it's nbd to me.
And it's rough bc like...
Idk I didn't love him really.
Like I've only been in love with one person and that relationship still wrecks me. So I feel bad that I'm not more sympathetic to Calvin.
the problem here i dont think is sympathy
i understand how he feels
it's a horrible feeling
but iunno
iunno about your perspective but from where i see it
and honestly it sucks
and a shitty situation to be in
and you especially dont try to drag the person you supposedly love in with you
you stop digging
but if you are in a hole
It's the denial portion
You know? Like you don't want to believe it's going to be gone and over
but he isn't 15
havnet we all been there before?
I didn't really get hurt intensely until I was a junior in college
hmm interesting
Not every one
Before then the breakups were meh
nah the relationships in hs (not just mine but like friensd too) werent more intense
well ultimately
and to stop talking to you
the best thing for him is to move on
Man you had some intense high school dating haha
Yeah I agree
you sholdnt have to be made to feel bad for being the mature person in this scenario
we were all just stupid emotional teenagers who thought every little thing was the end of the world
It's fine. I just don't want to argue with him anymore
I just feel like I'm being unreasonably mean sometimes. He just brings out the worst in me
yeah
you should just not talk for a while
Was vegas fun?
True
ya! so much fun
Are you back and recovered?
haha I usually don't need recovery
Too strong
hahaha
we were so drunk thisweekend
6
LOL ya
Y'all seemed like it
How big was your group
All dudes?
so its actually kinda complicated
which is kinda rude
1 girl in there
was supposed to be 8 people originally
but two of them were a couple
and thety just broke up
and the guy came not the girl
and then one of the people aki invited invited a bunch of her friensd without telling him
and the whole trip she was jsut being super rude
so we just kinda split up
so the rest of us hung out in a group of 6
i kept telling aki we need a better ratio or else we wont get into a lot of clubs
so planning wise it was a shitshow
so its all good
But it was her friends?
loool
but he didnt believe me and then that happened
this is why i always plan everything
but
despite that
Lol
it ws a lot of fun
Wait I thought the girl didn't come?
there were 3 girls originally
thats another girl
Dude lol. Aki invited calvin to go out to that bar for his bday
Ah
Lol so sorry if it's awk
Oh I guess you won't be there lol
Nvm
hahaha
oh man
will you still go?
Lol yeah ofc
Are you going to Africa for work? Sorry I forgot
going to africa for your parents
Oh ofc
Silly me

just curious if the girl you said wasn't cute is her
nono the point isn't heidi
On bumble bff
cuz he did match with her haha
Oh lol

>.>
Idk dude
hahaha
Did they hook up
so many people and super disorganized
nah I was just curious haha
üò¨
also this gate is a shitshow
LAX mang
it's the worst airport I've always hated it
I think I'm used to LAX lol
ugh
LOOOOL
LOL what is this listing?!?
might be a diff language
Lolllllll
LOLLLLL
cum means with in like Latin or something right
LOL
a troll post
or is just
hello from Ethiopia
waiting for next flight haha
PICS!!!
at airport
drinking beers
at bar
3 hours transfer time
I'm bored
Oooh do something Ethiopian
every restaurant is Chinese in this airport LOL
o man I wish I could find some
Eat some Ethiopian food
I'm drinking beer
this is what happens when China invests billions in Africa
Well
China prob built this airport
A lot of Chinese people actually immigrated to Africa
A while back
isn't it still happening?
China and africa has a very interesting relationship
There's actually a large population of African Chinese
Yeah
But when the mining industry was big a lot of Chinese immigrated
ohh that makes sense
My parents have a lot of Chinese friends in Angola lol
how long ago was this
like this century? or long time ago
ohhhh cool didn't know that serial
the first time we met
I've never been to Africa
Ummm more than half a century. I forget exactly though
detail
It's too hard for me to get a visa
wait did you visit your parents a lot in Angola?
I remember I asked
No
but I forgot
oh :(
haha
*visa to Angola not Africa
africa is trying to make a pan africa passport
so in some years that statement would be accurate
wait are you already
What
are you trying to get American citizenship
I forget
maybe I'm thinking of someone else
I was talking to someone who hadn't gotten American citizenship for a long time
iunno
did cat ever respond
Ohhhhhhhh
ugh
"no"
Cat rejected me
no response or just sent back a "not"
No response
aww :(
maybe they were just looking for a different CATegory of people
I'm sure they didn't mean to hurt your felines
I'm sad they didn't ask meowt
ah who am I kitten they prob just are too busy with all their matches to respond
I was pawsitive we would be a good match
it's probably because you didn't spell your name Catherine or catarina
what if it's a catfish
and it's not a cat at all behind the profile!
üòÆ that's be a CATastrophe
Lollll
did you run out of puns?
üò¨
üò¨
still haven't caught sight of your parents yet
They're right behind you
but I'm lying down in bed
üò¨
what doing
We dranked
Wine night
oo yum!
who's your friends
Girls from work :)
Oooh girl
ooo
yay
No.
have y'all hung out since you went drinking
It's weird he wants to grab dinner
Bc like.
Unless you only wanna hook up
Why would you not ask a girl out until a week later
hmm
maybe he's busy
that's possible too
good*
or he just wants to be friends
sometimes I ask girl to get dinner without any intentions
cuz we have no mutual friends
it's just a foody way to catch up
so maybe that's why :/
Should I ask?
I don't really want to go on a friend dinner
Jason
Jason
Should I ask if it's a friend dinner
I asked
Just us or wit there
Lol he said just us
and if it's inconclusive
is this a date
no like when y'all meet up
that's fine to ask ya
Others
ohh
but just you two doesn't necessarily imply date
I'd say just go on it
and be flirty
Oh so what should I ask
Oh ok
just ask
When now?
and if you can't tell if he's flirting bad
I think being straight forward works pretty well
Lollll ok
be flirty during it
back
after a bit just ask hahaha
itS just scary to do
but if you can do it it works
K
üò¨
üò¨
man africa is so cold
I'm confused
Lollll
What's avg temp there during the day
Man that face is so versatile
man didnt even bring a jacket
it's 60s today loool
üò¨
üò¨
LOL yaa
Noob
it said 80-90
Kilimanjaro
Brererwrwrrrr
Did you not check the weather?!
I did!
At least clothes are prob cheap
it's cuz we are up the mountain
tomorrow we going to Highlands which will be even colder loool
Who are you with
then after that is Serengeti which will be normal africa heat
Who
it's an REI safari group
o ibdknto know them
except my friend from hs
Who is your friend
Oh lol yeah that was who I was getting at
ohhh
she lives in nyc
you don't know her
she planned the trip and asked if I wanted to join cuz her other friends dropped out
well she's moving back to bay area for her MBA
we were highschool friends
üò¨
üò¨
the coffee was good but the teas they had were so good
üò¨
it was cool
we went to a coffee plantation today
Oooh that sounds fun!
do you like coffee?
yeah!
I recently do :) but I don't know much about it.
ooo
Are you a coffee expert?
i bought some beans from this place
ill give you some once im back
i like coffee but i cant drink much :(
Why can't you drink it much
they were so cheap
im not
ryan is!
Ooooh ty!!
I don't know how to make it from beans lol
caffeine doesnt treat me well
i get really anxious if i drink caffeine
Oh. Do you drink energy drinks or soda?
no
Oh wowwww
No redbull shots
alcohol completely negates the effects of caffeine
and i enjoy the taste of coffee so sometimes i drink it and then drink a beer afterwards so i dont get anxious
Wait in general?
Oh really?
no
well soda doesnt have a problem for me
but i dont really like it that much
i dont care too much for sweets
i love carbs enough as it is
if i liked sweets too id be so fat
LOL
oh i can take redbull shots
LOL
oh i dont drink it together
redbull shots are pretty much four locos too right?
i just drink a beer and it usually fixes it
Or for you?
for me im not sure if other people
But what about the dangers of four locos
just like if i drink a cup of coffee
and then like half an hour later i start feeling bad
im just waiting for dinner in half an hour
i think people who get sick from four loco just take too much
i think it tastes weird
i dont like redbull tho
also ugh the wifi here is so slow
LOL
I like Red Bull
Ohhh
I love the taste of a lot of energy drinks actually lol
ooo interesting!
Im surprise though bc I thought cs people drank energy drinks
i always foun d them kinda strange
yeah a lot do haha
i never really got into it
i would love to have some type of drink that can make me feel more awake but unfortunatley it doesnt work :(
but i guess its more because i cant take caffeine rather than the taste
Ah
i think its because my mom has a thyroid problem
maybe its genetic? and i have very minor thyroid problem too? iunno
...wait how does that impact things?
so maybe i have super mild problem too but its too mild for me to feel normally and only shows up when i drink caffeine
thyroid problems can cause anxiety, but i dont have anxiety, only when i drink caffeine
she has anxiety problems a lot
and when i drink caffeine i feel like how she describes her symptoms
Oh....wow I didn't know that.
But I know I seem to like the taste of caffeinated things
I think someone once told me I have anxiety symptoms but I don't really know what those are
Hmm. I think I might have that problem. But I'm not sure
sometimes feel short of breath
uncomfortable quick heart rate
ohhh
I just like feel lump in throat
if I try to sleep I like get shocked awake every few mins
very in unpleasant
Omg üòû that sucks
i know...
i jsut try to avoid it
hahaha
yeaaa maybe
i dont!
You get Asian glow
i have some genes im really glad for and some im not
its ok
i like that i can drink a lot and dont have asian glow and never get sunburned
Maybe it's a swap for your extremely high alcohol tolerance
LOL Jason
LOL
Be real.
Uhhh yes you do lol
i actually dont
Your face gets so red
Lol
I know you're in Africa
or anyone really
im going to egypt in a few days
but i do turn red if its hot
i dont turn red from alcohol at all
i cant stand heat at ll
you can ask ryan
But I didn't know you were so up north
haha
In
huh?
Egypt
in tanzania rn
In de Nile
i wasnt even the first person to bring it up
and i didnt believe
unless its super hot
also another bad gene
wow
rude
LOL
people kept telling me this
then i started looking at myself in mirror
also that pun doe
Kkkkkkk
i actually never turn red
then i turn red even if sober
LOL
i have tiny bladder
so annoying onroadrrpw and sturr
road trips and stuff
Lollllll
But you're a guy so you can pee anywhere
I definitely think you have Asian glow though

didn't y'all hang out
How was chris
What
you said he asked to hang out
But like idk.
Oh no. I had akis thing
And he was busy Friday
So we're going to hang out Thursday.
are you not feeling it anymore
Idk if it's even a date
I'm very torn about this bc it's like pretty clear he's like probably dating around
Dinner
Like I talked to Ryan about it
He doesn't message me or try to talk to me at all in between
It took him over a week to ask me to dinner
well I think he's obviously dating around
true
well he doesn't text much in general
Yeah...
like why would you expect him not to be
you are too
Yeah
But like no messages between
Is like...I'm pretty low priority then
Like if I'm into someone I try to talk at least you know?
but ya
Yeah
even if you don't text much
if you are interested in someone
It feel bad.
Yeah
youd make more of an effort
So. Idk.
even if not all the time
it's oK :/
*feels
Yeah.
maybe he just wants to make a friend
though why is he asking for one on one hangouts
Yeah but then like. Idk. We should hang out with everyone
if want to be friends wouldn't it be better to just invite you to his things
Yeah
I agree
so not too sure
Not go to dinner
maybe he's like a bit interested but like it's low prio
And if he just wants to hook up
Let's just get drinks and hook up
o he asked for dinner
But like wtf you expect me to not have weekend plans lol
Yeah.
Why would you ask a girl to dinner for Saturday night on Thursday.
Dumb.
I wish I knew someone who could know and just tell me like "yo - there's a 75% chance this isn't going to happen"
I feel like that's so
LOL
yet
but it happens because people are all a lil bad
No but the game is supposed to be fun
but that's part of the game tho
like I'm sure he doesn't even know himself
Dude this isn't fun.
no I'm not saying it's fun
fuck the game
Dating in college was way more fun
like I bet he isn't sure what he wants yet
Yeah
ya
I've known girls who's done that to me too
sometimes seems super interested other times not
think about it
But like - I don't know, but I do know I only want to participate in fun, happy things
Not like meh, bleh shit
cuz they can't figure out
ya agreed
Yeah.
I don't think I'm about that life though
Should I say smth
When we meet up
I tthink this isn't fun tho because you are too interested
if you aren't sure either
tthen this is just whatever
yeah
I shouldn't care so much.
cuz if this was just some random guy you just met
ya
but you are stressing out over it cuz you hyped him up already
You're right
all of this wouldn't matter that much
Yeah. You're right.
But I can't even figure out if these meetings are dates or not
If this was some guy I just met, I'd probably be like "hey sorry this isn't gonna work out"
Fuck.
I'm thinking way too much about this
ya
and do things last minute
Omg. Do you think he asked me so late, for Saturday
Bc someone cancelled
just hang out and then see how flirty it is
Dude fuckkkkk that shit
som people just don't like planning shit
and then just ask him yo is this a date
during the dinner
maybe maybe not
like Aki LOL
Man. Ducking.
I always tell other girls, you shouldn't like guy who don't like you
Fuck. Why can't I take my own advice.
He's not all fucking that. Why do I have to make it such a big deal.
It's a waste of time
If it already doesn't work, it's not going to work
Everyone has been telling me this doesn't look good.
like naaah fuck the advice
ya :(
it happens
I totally get it
i give all tjis advice
but if I fall for someone I'm like that too
heart wants what it wants
If it's super casual
Hey so how's dating going for you so far
LOL that first date I went on last last week the girl asked me that
How soon did she ask if
Oh really?
Should I be like
I'm  not sure
Bc then I'll know. If he's having fun with it, I can drop it
and I honestly thought that was super weird
*it
ya like what do I tell you
she just randomly brought it up
how's your dating life etc
how was last one
she asked like how many girls have I dated
iunno a few hours in
What did you say
etc
why am I gonna talk about other girls with you
I was thinking wtf
I jjust said some vague stuff and changed subject
Reddit is a bad source
On average
Oh
How many people do you go out with per week
not that much
keep getting fobs LOL
Ok. I should just
I don't put too much effort into it and I'm pretty picky
less than 1 haha
>.>
:/
also I think my dating app profiles suck
Shut up about this until Thursday
I will drop it.
If Thursday isn't perfect and he still doesn't want to talk to me ever outside of it
Fine.
Wait ask him what
fuck it right?
ya
I say at end of Thursday just ask him
might as well right
Is it a date
like just ask him if this is a date LOL
What time of day do you usually ask girls out btw.
LOL
just have a talk
Wait if he pays for things
cuz like if you are gonna just cut it off anyway
Oh
Yeah true
ya is a good signal
Ok
nah
Like does that indicate anything?
Wait what time of day
Do you usually ask girls out
wwell I also don't go on that many dates so iunno if I have enough data
but I just ask whether
whenever
I don't take too much stock of the time
I mean as long as it isn't like super late at night
Like you'd ask during work
Ok ok ok
Enjoy the lions T________T
you over thinking cuz #love
Omg what am I saying
I'm being dumb
Ok ty Jason
Sorry
ya I'd ask during work hours
i think it literally doesn't matter
>.>
did Aki end up separating you and Calvin during his many dinners
Luckily
saw Aki post a pic with him in it
he did go
I didn't see calvin
I don't think he even came
I didn't know that they were friends
oh
so I guess was a diff dinner
hahahaha
I didn't go to dinner lol
Oh he did
Link?
on fb
Wait where was the pic
ohhh
a few days ago
dunno how to link on the app
im on phone
lol click share
And then send in messenger
ohh
wtf they got rid of the share button
kk
hhere's screenshot
Oh that must've not been on Saturday
Bc he shared it Saturday morning
oh ya I said a few days ago haha
But I just went to dinner
I didn't know when yours was
Lol it was supposed to be yesterday
ohhh
What time is it in Africa
*drinks I mean
Not dinner
8 am
Monday
I dont think its a big deal
hahahaha
LOL ryab said you told him about Albert asking you out
might as well try right
but I told him I don't think it'd be a good match
Well it just came up
Oh
Yeahhhh
he was teasing about how you flaked on Friday or something
Bc he was messaging me a lot
oh hahaha
he stole that joke from me
he said to post croissants LOL
Yeahhhhh
I hope not
It felt awk bc he came over to Ryan's when ryan and I were just hanging out
hahaha I don't think he's still trying to get at you
Yeah
Idk today he requested to follow me on instagram
And like he's nice but
Idk if our personalities mesh
And we started talking about dating and Idk. It was a bit awk.
really? I think you are over thinking it
I don't think I'm overthinking lol
he's not in love like you re with Chris
he literally just told me
he's like ah she said no no big deal might as well ask
don't think he's still going after you
Yeah
I don't really think about it
Yeah. I mean I don't think anything of it
"I think katherine is super cute should I ask her out"
and then after wards
ohhhh
It's just that I don't think we mesh as friends yet
you mean awk in that way
Yeah
I mean when he came over to hang
really? you don't feel like you have good enough rapport to be friends?
not like awk as in you are afraid he's in love with you
Like idk if I'm on a message him every day basis...
No lol
oh haha
And when we all had dinner
I felt it was meh.
I think he just does that
But like
Like we didn't really chat then, or click
So it seems odd that we'd joke like that online? Idk.
Not that I have anything against him.
he jokes like that to all hid coworkers
Ah ok.
like he always showing slack logs to me
of him teasing random people at work
Ah ok
even ones he doesn't know that well
even his boss LOL
Ok.
Yeah
There's only two things I'm really obsessing over right now, so I can't really obsess over much else :P
Sure.
I mean lol I really don't think about it at all
I think he seems friendly - I just think I had to see him around a bit more.
hahaha
when's last time saw doctor sac
the movie?
Oh. Yeah
So lol. Idk wtf that was.
I think I got dumped lol
He messaged me Thursday and we haven't talked since
Which I'm ok with bc we went on 4 dates and he didn't try to make a move
hmm
how often do you use to talk?
oh :(
Like a couple texts back and forth everyday
He would text me nearly every day to ask how my day was
what was last thing he said
what did he say?
And I just didn't text back
But like. I felt like he wasn't interested really so I didn't feel the need to
dang it won't load
hmm
how long gap before he responded with the cardiology comment
oh it loaded
Ah
He has time off where he watches basketball VODs
wat
you didn't even respond to his message
Like, he's busy during his rotation
And then
and you are complaining he's not interested enough?
hahaha
And he responded Thursday morning
Yeah but if he was into it, I would've messaged me again
lol I don't think so
Like I asked him Wednesday night
that's not that bad tho
more like you dumped him
I just don't think he's interested
And he didn't ask me about my weekend plans or set up a next meeting
And it's not like I've hyped him up like I unfortunately did with chris
And texts me like every half hour if even
So if he's not totally into me, I don't need to like check in to make sure
true but I feel like you are placing a lot of expectations on him
do you ask about his weekend plans?
maybe he's just bad at dating
I mean I asked him out last time
true
I don't think it's a huge expectation to have him text me
Lol is it?
but then again there's a point to be made that if he isn't messaging you enough now then it's not really gonna change
so if that's what you need maybe he isn't the right guy
Yeah basically
ya
I just meant like
Like - I probably message Ryan and you more than any guy lol
do you text him a lot?
We did like every day yeah
But not like conversations
ya true
vut my point is that
haha true but
I think so
hmm
are you usually the one waiting for a response?
we are us
Like if a guy is trying to be cool or not
Bc I'm chatty lol
‚ù§Ô∏è
Yeah it's hard to tell
LOL
Haha me toooo
glad you understand
I'm also just needy LOL
But like - I want a guy who can eventually be clingy
thats so funny
who can eventually be clingy
LOOOL
but that's so funny to hear you day
lIke I get it
Bc it's not cool
I don't know :/
But it's hard bc I know they can't be initially clingy lol
Yeah. So how can I find the ones that are secretly so
llook for guys with similar traits I guess LOL
Idk Jason
lol I've been trying to be chill
But secretly no chill
like I spam üò¨ when I want attention
Oh bc you don't like them
well we are both clingy what signs do we exibit
Oooh good point
tho some if my traits don't really apply to dating
LOL I wouldn't do that to someone on a first few dates
prob never gonna be
üò¨
Haha ofc
üò¨
tho I think good point about doctor
üò¨
hmm iunno
cuz if after first few dates still not super chatty yet
Yeah
I just don't want to think I misunderstood
Should. I say hi just in case
I feel bad now though lol
ifs ok!
True
if he's not the right person
K have funnnnn

Something punny about her bio I guess
üëÖüëÖüëÖüëÖüí¶üí¶üí¶
And then
üçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜ

LOOOOL
damn katherine
üò¨
Did you use my pickup line
Hi
Are you still African
Omg so fun!!!
im in dubai now
9 hour layover
help katherine
Do Burj Khalifa
And the mall
And go on a night ferry across to the markets!!!!
but its 1 am
1230
Go explore
Oh....lol idk
I'm sure there are a lot of clubs open lol
ahh
ill google it
are things open?
My layover was in the afternoon
Do smth luxury though so you can say you did :)
i had a huge headache yesterday in cairo
Oh....hydrate better then and don't drink
let me see if its feasible at this hour
haha! true
i really wanna go up the burj
Yeah it's nice
im kinda sick of the heat tho
yeah
LOL.
but prob cant see anythign at this hour
ok ill say your pickup line
Nice.
what is it again?
Lol. Idk.
Go look.
nah
Wait. Do all girls have like a sexy photo?
senttttttttt
Like if Allan had a sister
LOL
lol actually that girl looks kind of like Allan.
But seriously that girl's bio though lol
a lot of girls dont put any effort into their profiles
oh atually it was weird
LOL
now that you say that
i didnt want to go cuz i thought itd be too much work to organize everything
im seeing it
after allan's party on thursday we went to karaoke
then i charged everyone
but people kept convincing me saying why would i have to organize everything
evnetually i went
so i ended up having to pay for everything on my card
but anyway
and declined it
except allan just said booo lame
im confused
and no one was talking to the counter to get us a room
and everyone paid their part
??
Lol maybe just re-request him
Maybe that though
Does he maybe think that he shouldn't pay bc it's his thing?
why shouldnt he pay
but what
its not like his birthday or anything
when i plan parties i always end up paying way more than everyone else
like buying alc and stuff
I actually don't get that either
maybe
Yeah, idk.
and its fine
Yeah...me neither but I'm also poor
i dont even know him and dont feel like a having a talk about it
>.>
its fine it wasnt too much money
I guess.
i dont like confrontations
But I get what you mean
That's really awk of him to do that.
i guess im just paying to avoid the potential awkwardness
i really avoid potentially awkward conversations
hahahha true
yeah
Lol, but that sucks bc you shouldn't have to
No I think it's not weird you would not want that. It's very reasonable
not just make a joke and then assume i know what he means by it
he should just say it
Yeah.
Yeah
i should really learn to not worry so much about that though
like if he didnt want to pay and had a reason
oh well
ready for the first world
kinda excited to go home now
It's ok. You don't have to pretend to like Nature
which is fine cuz the nature was great
Lol.
hahaha
intenret is too shit everywhere on this trip
Especially with me
i just like nature with internet
i do like nature though
>:(
I'll keep it a secret
üò¨
do you like nature
No
i actauly do really enjoy nature
I actually don't. Like that's why I decline camping
LOL
really??
thats why i go camping and stuff
I actually laughed
why not tho
LOL
That's a good one haha
>:(
maybe you havent properly natured
you havent natured with me
thats why
LOL

üò¨
Is bonfire a good idea this weekend
also with so many people who agreed to come would be hard to reschedule
hmm the fire will keep us warm
I don't think sf will get any warmer
Ok
okk
As long as we bring good blankets :)
we can also finalize plans tonight
:D
have you ever had a dog
i want a dog
I love dogs
Hehe yes
And cats
also teach me how to take care of it if i get one
i want one
help play with it if i get one
might get one
i know nothing about dogs
how hard is potty training
Omg!!!
Omg wait are you serious?
And def puppies are way harder
Maybe you should try to foster first!
whats foster?
Potty training takes a bit. Maybe a month or two
I think it's harder for an apartment
not sure yet tho
gonna resaerch and decide if i want
okok
Omgggggg
like foster means take someone's unwated adult dog?
ohh
So you can free up the space in the shelter
And you home them until they're adopted
i dont need to get a puppy
ohhh
im down
like just foster it and then i can decide
And a lot of times they don't want fosters to adopt so they can keep fostering
A little...
Or get a cat :3
so its less committment
so its in theory already trained
wait why dont i just adopt it then
oh i see
if i like it i can keep
It's like you help take in a shelter dog
You can! But it's less permanent up front
if i can get a pretrained
i dont like cats tho
i find having a cat a negative experience :(
kittens are cute
LOL
I don't like babies that much lol
Like my maternal instinct kicks in super hard
i can pretend to be a cat
and then come scratch your face once in a while
<3
like at all
Like so much lol
ill sit in a corner and ignore you
hahaha
Oh üòû
I love cats and dogs
But when I see animals, I'm like -- setting rules and bedtimes and training
Lol cats aren't like that. They just don't love people blindly
hahaha yeah im exaggerating
I feel like a dog is a huge step. It's like having a baby
What's making you want a dog?
its just a lot of work
so i wasnt sure if i wanted to
oh i always wanted a dog
LOL
i wanted to pet all the safari animals
Then why now?
Oh
dunno
best time to get one
LOL.
also ava is pet friendly and blend office is too
and thought maybe i should just say fuck it and get a dog
LOL
also is it a common thing to adopt a pretrained dog?
how do i pick a breed
Don't pick a breed
And by pretrained do you mean potty trained? A lot of dogs age 1 or older are potty trained
ohh ok
Adopt! Don't shop! :)
yeah im gonna adopt
i dont think id be partial to one specific breed
hmm how do i research breeds then
If you really like a breed, there are breed rescues
ohhh i see
dont want a difficult breed as a first dog
A lot of shelters let you play with them and meet with them
write down which breesd they are
Yay ^^
but i would want one that's known to have easier going personalities
look for ones i like
i dont think breeders are even legal in sf
Then you should just go to shelters and look
If you ever want to go - I can come with you! I only know the city shelter though bc I cat volunteer there
i like either fluffy or short haired doogs
and then google it
Well - a lot of shelter dogs will be mixed
ooo
I think the SFSPCA will have more dogs
Yeah
ahh true
Lol
but yeah lets go once i decide
ok!!
ima google a lot more
Mk
UGH. I'm so single.
I never understood the struggle until now
This is so hard. Being single. Its like constantly in the back of my mind and I can even watch anime or worry about work without also thinking about how single I am
UGHHHHHHHHHH
Omg it's been 4 months only.
haha why is it such a big struggle?
Just being alone
It's so weird.
It's more like...I don't feel comfortable
But I'm so alone lol
hmm
but i thought you arent actually looking for a relationship rn
what are you worrying over?
But I don't have anyone I want to be with. I just am not used to coming home to no one
so are you lonely and miss the companionship?
Yeah
How to be single
hmm
maybe it's good to stay single for a bit more then
like that sounds hard but like
LOL
Yeah. I know.
yeah
i think it's important to be comfortable with yourself
i udnerstand if you get lonely
Haha
yeaaah i know
everyone gets lonely and thats fine and a healthy emotion to feel
being uneasy by not having someone
Yeah. I knowwwwe
But it's harddd
just enjoy yourself for a while
have fun do whatever
but
is not as healthy
it gets easier
-.-
>.> bleh
and then eventually you'll meet someone you actaully want to seriously date
it will also make it easier
They get caught up in life and just never meet the right person
Like
Ever
wat
anything can happen
Some people never meet people again
yeah some people also get struck by lightning and die
why dwell on it
T______T fine
and thats fine
do things you want to do
hang out with people
but acting desperate isnt a way to prevent that from happening
do hobbies
or even date around
do whatever
cuz that can be a trap too
where you focus so much on yourself that ou stop meeting people
but like
im not saying stop looking for a relationship
try not to worry about not having someone
just live your life
Yeah that makes sense lol. It's basically everything I already know but I still want to complain about it
Like word vomit
yeah i get it
understanding that you shouldnt feel some way doesnt mean you'll stop feeling that way
takes time
it's hard
hahaha
but you'll get over it
and will have an easier time being yourself
since you'll have a better idea of what you want
hahaha
Lol nah.
and once you do it will make your next relationship healthier too
i think a relationship should be
I don't believe that since I've already had the kind of relationship I want
Ah yeah.
not 0.5 + 0.5 = 1
But I do need to chill and not be so antsy about being alone
but it makes it easier
im not saying it's impossible to have a good relationship without knowing how to be alone
1+1 = 1.8
I wish I had a cat.
hahahaha
üòø
to keep you company?
its ok
you can play with dog if i get one

and topic got to some girl i dated for a bit in south bay
and hes like not all of them
and how he dated some girls in south bay who werent like that
about when chris talked about his ex who was white
and i said how i dont like how most girls i meet in south bay are less adventurous and are more of home bodies
and briefly talked about one of them
and she was white
Plan ruined
??
He messaged me at like 1 something am
So I had to respond - and just be like wth, are you ok
Saying sorry he didn't respond that he had to go get staples in his head
what the heck
oh jeez
But like holy shit
ya
So I'm sure he's staying home just resting up today
damn that timing
ya
I know right
....I probably should delay that convo
Yeahhhh
Yeahhhhhhhhh
if he's all injured
just wait a few days i guess
damn
LOL.
not the best time to talk about that
But like damn. Hope he's ok
LOL
Yeah
Ew holy shit

what type of people arent to be trusted and stuff
i keep seeing on askreddit posts like
"if someone a gossiper stay away!!!"
ive nevre agreed with that
LOL
who cares?
fucking love gossip
a common thing people keep posting is like
"they might gossip about you too"
and im 100% sure people gossip about me too
What did the janitor say when he jumped out of the closet?
Omg you post too fast
:
I wanted to say
people gonna gossip about you no matter what
üê´
SUPPLIES!!!
Ok but yeah I agree
I LOVE GOSSIP
Wait link me the thread

Crazy girlfriends
So I did a crazy thing today
I looked up calvin and I's chat history
tell tell tell
Like you know when people are like "don't stick your dick in crazy"
And it was def more double sided but I analyzed it a bit lol
To see how that started off
And I think if I have "boyfriends" to tie me over
But like. I'm pretty sure that's crazy of me to do.
I can seem less crazy for the like #goals guys
but I think that's fair
you don't force them to follow your expectations
you are expecting a lot
but like that's fine
I don't think you are being crazy
LOOOL

*dating

He just guilt trips me a lot about the satin thing
satin  cloth
Is the name Sah-teen spelled Satin
Oh how do you know
ya I know
ya he does
Satin cloth?
o I saw his messages
Yeah.
ugh
about it
ok I he keeps doing that I'll talk to him a lot it
not a big deal
he's not needy like us
I want to stop talking to him rn. But like I can't without it being like I'm ignoring him and he's coming on Friday
just don't open the window
nono ts fine
LOL
ya
You sure
absolutely
Even when I don't want to
Ugh
Not responding
I have a hard time
This escalated super quick.
Fuck. He responded to it
Wtf. Is ari involved
bit he doesn't know our conversation
oh nah he's just sitting near me
>:x
üê´
Ooh glhf!
it's ok
üê´
Tfti
ya you can just stop the Convo with Albert
he wanted to discuss companies LOL
told me to come over
Haha
it's okkkkk
2manyKatherine
Omg....Albert -.-"
never too many
‚ù§Ô∏è
never too many jasons
Yes sir
haha
Woah.
that's a lot of Katherines
you do a great job of being 5 people in one
Dude.....
But like.
ugh
Ugh. Ok like don't talk to Albert about it
whats he saying now?
Dude. It's too much.
And he linked me a motivational YouTube
I think it will make it worse
But like don't talk to him about it
hmm
so hes more just talking about himself now
Yeah it seems like it? Idk
hes been sad about it for a bit
you dont know her
Ok.
hes pretty sad about some other girl rn
It's ok. He's getting it all out I think
there was some girl he really liked
yeah
Oh who
He said a lot of stuff now
but all of this is more because of his core issue
Yeah he's been ranting for a while about relationship stuff
But I don't want to be like "dude it's ok"
Oh
one of his friends
Bc I want to say things to comfort him
Ok. 100% is it not me
yeah
i mean i think hes a tad sad about your rejection
And relate
not you
Ok nvm then
yeah
I just want him to know this happens to everyone and that he's not alone in it
thats good to hear i htink

üê´
üê´
I was just about to say
yay dinner
Yay food!!!
yup! 7
where are you going at 8
I have to be somewhere at 8, but it's close
yay
It's at 7 right?
hmm have I been there sounds super familiar
Natoma Cabana?
is it a date??
üòû
it*
why sad! it's will be great!
Just some guy
Kyle?
No
Idk. I don't really want to date around anymore lol.
The novelty has already worn off
I'm just like meh now
you know what would really spice up this date
hmm
Lol.
on a completely unrelated note do you know where sells fake mustaches?
Corgicon?
And no banter
Just idk.
Idk i don't have high hopes bc we didn't even joke around much
corgicon is in sat
oh  .
those are usually the ones I just stop talking to
Maybe dating for looks is shitty
your most successful relationship wasn't for looks
ya lol
I think you think you want to just have fun and date hot guys
but in your heart that's not what you want
that's why this is so stressful
you actually want someone who cares a lot about you
and talks to you a lot
I think it's ok that you don't want a long commitment but I don't think you actually want something super casual
But I think I'm learning what I definitely don't want
I seriously don't know what I want
It's weird bc I see him like a baby bc I was an org mom
Man. There's this like kid. He's only 24, and he went to my college and recognized me from the org I led.
I want that.
But he's funny and has witty answers
But not in the form of a baby
smart funny witty
actually ya me too LOL
that's exactly what I'm looking for too
why are so many people so bad at conversation
who doesn't want that though
ya
I don't care about smart even though
but it's hard
Let's just laugh and have fun
Like wtf do I need someone that smart for
Like that's it
agreed
you can cover the intelligence for the both of you
I'm not trying to start a business...
It's not even that
Like I've never met someone so stupid I can't have a discussion about topics I want
Idk. Anyway.
Like only here in SF have I ever heard people say "oh they have to be smart"
oh really?
smart handsome successful etc
I only said smart because it's such a common thing people say
but ya honestly it's not a big deal
Yeah. Not that I think it's bad quality to look for!
Smart is good. It's just I don't see it impact relationships nearly as much as other factors
Sorry I feel like sometimes when I go against something, I go too hard
having good chemistry is much more important
ya I agree
smart is good but not too priority
Yeah and how people treat others
and wanting to spend time with you
agreed
on Sat
let's go
play with corgis
so corgicon is at noon
Libbey also going
after Costco
Mehhhhhh
Idk. Maybe
but im going
Lol
now you are going
Maybe
great
Yeah sure. I'll come get boba
>:(
you mean you'll come hang out with me
omg
https://www.ft.com/content/51d97262-82da-11e7-94e2-c5b903247afd
Oooh
maybe buy a house loool
should i sell some of my shares
maybe better to sell a bit and diversify
i wonder if i should hold onto it and hope for it to raise
i wonder what value theyd let us sell at
I need to marry me an uber employee and get divorced
downpayment
Dang.
ok not buy a house butl ike
LOL
thats not how divorce works
so i guess marry uber employee force him to sell his stocks and then divorce
you split 50/50 all assets earned after you married
LOL
Or do a prenup
lol yeah that was the point
Why
LOL
"if we get divorced i get all assets period"
That's extremely generous to me
have to be smart enough to get rich
I wish there was a more universal term for men that was the equivalent of "bitches"
LOL
SIGH
so this is why smart matters
You don't have to be smart to be rich lol. Look at our idiot president
he got elected because he knows how to deal with stupid people
haha trump isnt actually stupid though
he knows how to work people very well
hes just not very good at being a leader
dicks?
i think the term for men who are bitches is hmm
You say that. How many guys would say trump is smart enough to date
"Mo dicks, mo problems" is not true lol
Trump probably can't locate countries on a map that he's been to.
And nah, dicks isn't the same
Everyone is "smart" in some way
Yeah
hmm
oh you dont mean bitches as in
"that girl is such a bitch"
you mean it as in "get bitches son!!!!"
No yeah
dont think there is a word
hmm
get man bitches
So sad
Man bitches
manflesh LOL
Omg most athletic pug
doggo
hahahahahah
wanan go to a wedding?
When??
LOL
i think le tme check
uh sept 16?
oops
sept 23
Lol yeah. I'm going. With Ryan.
oh!
haha cool
hmm
LOL
LOL
he refused to say who his plus 1 is
i was hoping ryan can just drive my car home
damnit
since thers an open bar
LOL.
but if he does that how you are gonna get home
how were you gonna get there
No idea
hmm
Your car has 2 seats
Are you just driving there?
Wait how were you going to invite me and then ryan drive
wait huh good point
how was ryan planning on getting you there?
i mean its fine i can get another friend to drive me home
i dont get it
Lol I think he just wanted to troll you
why was ryan trying to keep this a secret
he told the bride to pretend she doesnt know also
it's actually annoying
cuz i always make a big deal about it when he doesnt give straight answers
i dont get it
i think he thinks its funny cuz he thinks ill get fomo from not knowing things
how is that a troll
but its actually just because im annoyed that we cant have a mature conversation
and he will like not give a straight answer on purpose
like sometimes in our group chat he'll mention he wont be available for some event
cuz like it's not a big deal
i dont actually care where you are going
and one of us will just causally ask oh cool what you doing
and that always annoys me
but now that you're acting all secretive it's making it into a big deal
Oh üòû yeah that doesn't sound like it's fun
Sorry I didn't know much about it - I thought it was a joke between you guys üòû
just makes it difficult to have a conversation
hahaha ya it's not a big deal
like if this was only thing I'd just be like ok that's an off color joke but whatever
it'd just annoying because it's not actually funny
but he's ari and he's learning
like ari does that too
and I have a lot more patience with him cuz I want to help him be better at communication and stuff
Yeah...I can see that
im proud
ari has improved a ton since I first met him
I don't mind his quirkiness
Yeah. I like hanging out with ari actually
He's cool
yeah
i like his quirkiness too
and i like helping him grow
cuz a lot of times he wont listen until i yell at him
Haha you're like his big brother
hahaha yea
i also give him a lot of tough love tho
people keep telling me im being mean to him but they dont get it
so i yelled at him
and then every time i yell at him i can tell he suddenly improves
i just want him to improve
to the point that everyone started saying lets never invite ari again
and then he got immediately better
like he used to have a huge problem with always being late
But that's a great quality
Wow
Jeez really?
That he can improve
That's like my ex.
well
anyone can improve
it takes a long time
yeah!
im a firm believer in that
Anyone can.
Yeah haha
saying no he will never get better
yeah :/
he constantly has a defeatist attitude
yeah
Not everyone eventually will
ari is pretty resistent to change though
SAME
üòû
Maybe it's a self esteem thing
i always yell at him when he says that
but not everyone will
Not like all the time, but sometimes small comments
But I think you guys are a bit harsh sometimes picking on him
ya true
Not all the time obviously! :)
I like to tease it's how I banter
but I do notice that occasionally some comments actually hurt him
Yeah. Just like sometimes here and there
and I think most of the time ari loves it
haha
not in the moment but like after wards
he's pretty good about calling us out though
I can tell y'all are close like that
but I appreciate if I get called out if I cross the line
ya I like teasing people and getting teased back
battling wits is fun
what are you most afraid of
Caterpillars
lol why
??
!

hahaha
you used to be an oreo???
I used to be 7 oreos
the idea that you just stop existing
my greatest fear is death
"thats not so scary it's just like before you were born"
i heard some people say like

I want to get off work
What're y'all doing

If I could just have that
My life would be complete
ugh
But with cats
>:(
why not dogs
CATS
Aka
Bc dogs are like clingy boys. They're nice.
But it feels so good to get love from normally non clingy ones, that become clingy
Haha
but i love clingy
if i dont like them then i hate it
but if i dont like you
if i like you then clingy is great
This was a weird metaphor I regret typing out
actually i love clingy if i like them back
LOL
Yeah same

My coworker who is married
Yeah
But you weren't interested
Even though she's hot
My coworker saw you in my photos lol
but i wasnt interested and didnt want to be rude
Yeah lol
hahaha
But why she's so cute
i didnt find her super cute haha
not saying she isnt but cute is pretty subjective anyway
Yeah
Oh
It's weird
I think she's pretty but in college
haha
Weird though
It was super hit or miss for her at parties
Yeah
and other people arent
I think I'm the same way. I'm hit or miss for people
so i guess some people are really into her looks
why not!
girls dont like you?
And very miss to girls lol
maybe girls dont like fun people
i like fun people
youre so fun
Lol. No like attractiveness
Yeah. Girls think I'm ugly lol
like most girls dont think you look good
And a LOT of people don't think I'm fun. I think I'm too intense for some people
oh
And it confuses them if I get hit on
why do they think you are ugly
what!

i wanted to get a projector and put it at the head of my bed
so i can lie in bed and watch shows
but then i decided ok maybe thats too lazy even for me
I like my couch.
Haha it's nice
I fall asleep on it a lot
Like last night I fell asleep on my couch, and got up at 5 am to wash up and move to my bed
ahahahhaha
you can hang out and then just sleep on couch if you wanted to
thats actually pretty nice thing about having bedroom living room combo
whered you get couch from? was it your old place
Nah dude I bought it
Super pricey too. Like almost $500
No regrets
I love it though
whoa
nice!
so you're saying i can crash there if going upstairs is too far
Like how parents do
and they are all so gross
LOL. I'll baby carry you up
And you can pretend you're still sleeping
LOOOL
dont think you can carry me im too fat :(
oh god i tried looking up "fat" in gifs
Yeah. My arms get tired just trying to French braid my hair
I need to pump some iron
every day you'll make it a little further
yeah just carry me home
good exercise
LOL.
after the first week you'll be able to move me out of the couch
after a month out of your apartment
after 2 months all the way back to my apartment
and i dont have to take the muni anymore
eventually you can just carry me to work

Oh shoot. Hmm.
Maybe we should postpone thrones? We can watch it a bit later?
i can come help!
how long does it take?
sounds fun
we can make the ratatoulle and then watch thrones after
look what we had for lunch
Ooh jealous!
Let's do thrones later if possible. I think I need some alone time to cook this weekend :)
ooo
what time
Mm idk. Let's chat Sunday
ok ok
Abt it
but I get to eat some
I dont think I'm handling it well from a mental well-being perspective
My work is very stressful lately.
let's make sure you have tons of fun tonight
aww
ya let's chat
Yeah. I just had a meeting with my managers
Haha yeah ok.
But if I say I'm unhappy about it , they think I'm being negative
And I'm being given way more bigger roles
I think I'm doing 3x the work of other people
Without them taking me off any
And now I feel like lost. Because work has been hell and I just keep it in to myself.
Im really struggling to keep this up. Idk. And it's rough not to have someone. Which is why I think I was excited at first about being single
Idk what to do.
but also
aww im sorry
i do think you should talk to your manager about it
just need to be tactful and make it not be negative
you need a hug
but would like to have some help
And they just make empty promises
maybe say that you love the new responsibilities and want to embrace making a bigger impact
I've been in this situation for 2 months already
I've talked to them
thats not fair on you
And today they were like "we'll get you support quick. Maybe in 3 months"
I feel really sad. Because i think it's setting me up to fail
yeah it definitely is
ughhh
When I know I can succeed and I'm watching others judge me for failing when I just can't take on more.
yeah thats a horrible situation
I know I should...
I'm so sorry to like pour all this out on you
I just don't know what to do.
dont be sorry
maybe it's a good time to start interviewing again
I'm hiding in a conference room right now and I just feel really trapped.
ughh
And I can't handle the situation emotionally right now
yeah thats really tough
It's just I don't want to fail anyone
how much time do you think you'll need to study?
it's such a difficult situation
Because I've had to take that time to work instead
yeah
I haven't been able to study outside of work.
they prob just think that you can take it so just keep dumping more responsibilities on you
So it's also preventing me from developing and finding a new job
Idk.
I usually study on the weekends
But I haven't had the energy to do work and study
i knew someone else who was like this too
no time to study and interview to get out
makes sense
Like a few hours
I'm emotionally drained
yeah it's a really tough situation to be in
I'm so bad at handling this situation
and its just like you're trapped
I know. I'm just not good enough yet for the job I want though
i do really think you should get out though
I can't just pick up any job
I need to pick the right one or it could hinder my future
what career i mean
what do you want to do?
And I have to be strategic about it because I signed a new lease, I just spent a lot from the breakup
yeah
And because I've been trying to shift careers
yeah
And I need to build out more side protecta
I want to go into data or user research. But a lot of them require quant degrees. And since I don't have one, I have to study a lot to prove I can do those things. So I take a lot of classes
*projects
hey do you want to go for a juice at joe and the juice
I can't.
I kind of was crying and I don't want anyone to know.
ohhh that makes sense
yeah
a walk could be nice
I can't leave the room right now.
aww :(
maybe you can just try to put in a little bit less effort at work
iunno
I'm up for promotion. But if I fail all this, no promotion.
I can't.
oh
whens the promotion decision happen?
But they've been declining my meetings
Idk
My managers won't talk to me about it until EOM
I don't know.
thats so bad
oh ughh
But I requested it at the beginning of august...
when i was at linkedin it was dysfunctional
im sure you'll find somewhere great
it's only after i went to uber that i realized how unhappy i was before
and i hated it so much
lmk if i can help you in anyway
Yeah it's fine. I think just, I want to take some time this weekend to think
yeah
I think if at EOM, if I don't get promoted...
yeah
I should quit and focus on studying
and be happy
i agree
And get a new job.
Yeah...
oh yeah let me do that real quick
Have you assigned stuff for tomorrow?
Wait who is smores
kk assigned
smores and drinks
anything else foodwise?
And what drinks

I'm taking Friday off
Not really this weekend
I don't know what I want haha
oh yeahh thats right
go do something fun on friday
no worries just lmk
I feel like I'm making bad life decisions
I ate two cereal cups today and a bunch of m&ms and shit
My stomach went from taut to flab in one night
And yesterday, I probably ate like 2000 calories no lie
aww
i prob eat 2500 when im not watching waht i eat
:(
wait 2000 calories isnt a lot!
oh but you're really light though so i guess its a lot
Oh. Maybe more than 2000
And how often is actually reckless
How often is normal
iunno how reckless is reckless
sorry one sec i have to give an interview
ill think on that
Like. How often do you do reckless things in your life
LOL
do you want a recklessometer
Yes
LOL
Did they pass
hahaha
but she could barely code
had a stellar resume
she wasnt very good
was excited to see what she can do
no :(
Too late. I already did it
So. Yup. My life.
I typed it, was thinking about it
And accidentally sent.
what types of recklessness are you thinking of?
Yeah
like making decisinos i know i shouldnt be doing but then going ehhhh fuck it
she has like 9 years of google
What was her resume?
yea
WTF as a programmer
Wait then why
what did you send?
Nothing important
thought shed be super experienced!
she ended up not being able to do much
jsut gave a lot of very vague answers
Or maybe she's just nervous
i dont know
and when we asked about her experience
...did she lie
oh well
yeah it's possible
it wasnt just like oh she c ouldnt figured out a problem
like very very basic things
LOL wow
but like the bad coding is not just nervousness
And bad with interviews
so which guy did you send it to :P
;)
is it not?
I'm not going to tell you until I get rejected by both
*SIGH*
like the two so far?
THERES TWO
oh
Lol like I honestly don't know why I'm still trying to hang with chris
Because. Idk.
oh
Just the two so far. Everyone else is whatever.
or just asked them out
did you send what i told you to send
But I do know I want to hang with kyle
My thinking is that i think he's ok just to BS with as friends
So that's kind of fun.
I don't want to ruin my chances with Kyle if I had any to begin with. So it's more scary to ask him
hahaha
just dont let it hurt yourself
then go for it
No. I asked chris for Thursday plans.
if you are really ok with just being whatever
I don't think so. If he's like nah
Then I think it will help me move on
From him at least.
what did you ask
Thursday plans!
Just
*?
ohhhh
LOL
why would he say nah to that
LOL.
Or even worse
I mean like.
I'm going to ask about drinks after that if he doesn't send me an awkwardly apologetic note about not being interested
"archived"
Really)
i dont think hes gonna send you an awkwardly apologetic note about not being interested
cuz i dont think he'll mind just dicking around
Like even a once a week boyfriend
oh really
yeah
and i think thats totally fine if thats what you want
i dont think thats
what i meant by dicking around
Bc like that's all I want from chris. And I'm not getting it
Like I just want a friend who I can treat like a temp boyfriend until I can find my real boyfriend
LOL
LOL jk I don't want to spoil the camel emoji!
Or like
Which was the doctor until he's got into his intense inpatient rotation
Like just hanging as friends.
üê´
randomly
but nothing serious
and
Nothing serious esp with chris
LOL
That's what I want
No that's what I want in a real boyfriend
Just attention
thought you want someone to comfort you
ohh gotcha
üê´
Oh
?
dicking around like
go on dates together
Oh then yes
and care about you
I want kyle to care lol
gotcha
but i think from that perspective
Not chris
prob texting you when you arent hanging out is probably not even on that list of expectations
yeah
Well. Let's see.
And he hasn't texted me today. Or yesterday.
It's the fact that I wrote this whole thing in case kyle texts me
just be careful
It's fine. It's not him who I'm worried about.
And I know he doesn't care but gaifinensuandnoaisubsiaoxuwnlsnfens
and you prepared a message for kyle
No I wrote up this thing for kyle
you senet teh chris thing
but you said you sent it
Yeah.
ohhh
ohh
No to chris
It's like. What to text him if he texts me again and it's not asking me out
right
something to push it along
But I end it in a smiley
*aggro
show!
Yeah.
To diffuse the aggro-mess
So. There's that.
haha you dont have to show
*ness
lol it's a little Afro
It's very like...Katherine sassy
LOL. But you're not going to agree with it.
but you should because im curious
ok fine
what if i promise to be unconditionally supportive
promise
LOL.
And not, Jason logical
But I doubt it. I just dream about it.
Idk. My dream is that I'll say that and he'll respond with a date time and place.
Idk if that's too...like is the last line too passive aggressive friendly?
I love the sass
hahaha
I'd totally respond well to that
I love sass
dunno if Kyle will tho
A girl can only dream
If he ever fucking texts me again
:(
Are you making anything for Ryan's BBQ?
i cant go remember? :(
groomsmen thing
Ohhhhh noooo
Let's go to museum
Lol why were you like
When is it
Then
so i was like
my thing is at 5
if we go in the morning or noon
then we go home you can go to bbq and ill go to my groomsmen thing
check it out  for a few hours
Ohhhh
hahahaha ya
what are you going to bring to bbq
Idk. Maybe I will just bring corn
Or maybe make smth?
Selfishly
I bet a lot of people won't bring anything
LOL corn
Freeloaders
should have a bouncer at the door
ya
giving out food tix
thanks for coming! you may get some food as soon as you decide to start being a real friend
people who don't bring anything gets a card that says
ya
Dude he should charge for food lol
Oooh omakase?
DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THAT
Wait. Did you buy that?
yup!!
and a foot bath thing LOL
YA I BOUGHT IT
i saw one for $19
my parents had one and i loved it
mine was like $50
I want a footbath!!!!
OMG
there were also cheaper ones
Oooh expensive
you did tell me about it!!!
I WANT ONE
i dont believe it tho
you may borrow mine if you want just clean it  loool
$17
omg katherine this is actually soo nice
LOL. Are you trying it now?
Jealous
Niceeeee
yessss
when did you last have one
:D
I've never tried
WAIT
youve never tried it before???
nooooo
youve just seen it?
Yup. Just seen my parents use it haha
oh what
you need to try
it's so nice
I want to try
LOL
I just scroll Facebook when I wake up
And omg you are so on top of my events lol
I deleted CMB
oh
why
Trying to improve my life lol
Idk
I had a date. It went really well. The guy is super nice.
I still texted kyle.
I sat there for a bit like wtf why do I care
Kyle is going to Seattle.
It's unhealthy
I don't know why I have all these things I can be doing to improve my life. And I still do the things that are crappy
what did you text to kyle
oh :/
Just to see if he had Thursday plans.
And he responds he's going to Seattle
that's rude
And that like triggered me lol
Yeah. Because he just he didn't like ask what's up
like you were mad about it?
oh
ya
It was dumb
I don't like that
Like why would that trigger me
Or say anything else about following up
Idk
And I met someone really funny and nice. So why did I not text him after but texted kyle
What the fuck is wrong with meeeeee
Ughhhhh
So now I think I'm going to slowly just. Stop. So since I didn't have any active convos on CMB. I just deleted it.
you just had one date with some new guy doesn't mean you'll forget everyone else immediately
there's nothing wrong with you!
I'm glad you are trying to make healthy choices though
he won't treat you well
also fuck Kyle
ya but something about him spoke to you I guess
But like I only had one date with Kyle
coupled with the fact that you like him but he's not really responding well back
you don't wanna lose
so it feels worse
>< man what makes me mad is that I knew that. Like after the date I knew he wasn't going to ask me out again
ya I don't get him
ugh
But then he kept texting me, which threw me off
And it's SO DEGRADING to be like "I'm down"
I think it's just to have a backup on weekends where he's out and drunk
if he's not down why keep messaging
And now I'm so into like anything with him. Even though I know he's not down
Haha I know right
that's so bad
fuck him
ugh
No more kyle talk.
I knowwwwww
Ok ok
:x
Do you think we're going to do board games or nah?
games don't
I'm not sure
I'm also down for movie if games font workout
Vanessa seems down
Or maybe we can do drinks and games
Like at the foundry
I'm down for that too!
??

Maybe we should just all do like a lodge trip idk
Probably very little üòû
kk let me google prices
Idk. I have to see

for 7 people
if we do sat sun night
so about $114.28 for lodging per person
For 3 nights?
Oh oops
Hm.
Yeah I'm prob not down
2 nights
*idk
let me see if i can find how much we paid for the jetski last time
I'll.
this is what we spent last time
That sounds fun but lodging and jet ski is prob over my budget üò¢
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tim6mCjcAK3eMGwnngRueQTVGafNz5vPS-x5NGbPrnI/edit?usp=sharing
let me see if there are cheaper
Oof. Yeah nah. Dw
Y'all go ahead

hotwire has $200 a night
that's $57 per person
for 2 nights
which is driving distance
we can do lake berryessa
alternatively
Fuck
Lol
lets do berryessa instead
Wait
nooo come :(
tahoe is only 78
if we do lake berryessa
I'm not part of this trip lol
which is even hotter
omg its 91 degrees there
What's berryessa
Jason
much cheaper
so you dont have to pay for the jetskiis
and you can cut more costs by just not going on the jetski
LOL. And just sit
comee it will be fun i promise
LOL.
LOL.
no its fun
what ends up happening every time is people just jet ski for an hour and then all just party on the boat
its just in napa
will be a day trip
cuz we'll have a speed boat too
Lol....maybe
so no lodging cost
you wont
I don't want y'all to impact your plans though just bc I'm poor

Dawwwww!!!

Australian Sheppard

No! I want!!!
So cute!!!!
Please introduce me to the dog tomorrow
I want that dog
:)
hmm so our dinner is at 7 but by 7 a lot of people already leave
haha
Or lmk when I should come so I can maximize dog action
so come earlier i can show you around
yo ucan come by 6 too if you have time
ok!!!
any time earlier is ok
Haha ok. I'll just come hang
yay sounds good!
its really nice
ill show you the roof on the new building
But that's still cool
Oh fuck I forgot I'm on diet
Ugh
Ooooh yeahhhhh
Oh and you're by Chinatown now right?
i alternate between dieting and eating way too much hahahhaa
yeah pretty close!
ohh how long are you gonna diet for?
im like always there now
Like that he's willing to risk a Friday
It's like a tiny thing right?
Ummm, idk. Until I feel like it's worth lol
Idk.
Btw if a guy asks you out for a Friday. Is that a good sign?
its possible that friday just happens to be when hes free
but like iunno dont read too much into it
its not a bad sign
like when i set up dates i dont really think too much about which day
i just pick what day works for me
which guy is this
Oh
:O
Ok.
>.>
or kyle
monday guy?
But I'm trying to justify it by saying Friday is still a risk
I'm like pretty sure he has a date Thursday
oh
Kyle
oh
how do you know?
I don't have plans Tuesday night yet lol. But I didn't want to be a Tuesday date.
I wanted a weekend date
did you send the snarky message?
or did you not need to
ohhh
He asked me what my week looked like next week.
He said Seattle. I didn't respond.
I asked him his Thursday plans
I didn't have to
I feel like he knows I'm trying to play the game though
Idk. I feel like he knows.
And he is just playing me better. Like responding right away to some of my texts to get me to respond, and then going cold until the next morning.
yeah
i know all the tricks too but i can never do it
I need like a spirit guide
But like. I think he knows things other guys don't
UGH. SO GOOD.
i always feel bad
all the tricks
How do guys get so good...
LOL
Maybe I need to read a player book
Like why send me such a sweet text after the date
FUCK I GOT PLAYED SO HARD
do you actually like him
hahahaha
well t hink about it though
And ask me on the date if I want to see him again
yeah
to counter the tactics
or is this just more playing on tilt
so your brain goes into chase mode
get you interested and then yank it away
i mean thats why it works
he just slowly fizzled
Although he's cool and I feel like we have chemistry, I'm cool to hang or not
but he didnt yank
It's fine
Like yanking away usually just makes me care less. Like with the doctor
And if we text one every other day
Idk
Chris yanked too lol
Like I hyped up chris so much and I still haven't ever school girled over it
Well Kyle didn't yank per se.
Maybe
But like. It was the only date that I was like...school girl over
yeah
hmm
I think he's just super smooth and I've never been played before so this is all very new to me
i dont even know if hes necessarily trying to play you
and then ask you out again
cuz if hes playing you why would he like
go on a date and then like ignore you for 3 weeks
but i dont quite get it
hes not even getting anything out of it
other than a lot of frustration on your part
It's like the crying in a Ferrari or happy on a bike thing
Back up chick
yeah
>.>
Attention
you shouldnt have to be a back up chick
gimme his number
ah
He's great.
maybe i should
Except money = charisma in this case
hes not that great
Dude you didn't go on a date with him
Would you be a billionaire's side chick or a poor dudes main chick
Idk if that would work
Like I think ignoring his texts is the best. But I wonder if I should introduce like....jealousy
Man. I want to ask another player .
dont crush me pls
LOL. No
I need to crush the competition
For advice
hahahaha
Jk lol
whtas your goal
Marry him and get divorced
LOL
Make him fall in love with me until I find someone better
The unrealistic dream is he changes for me. But I know. I know....#justgirlthings
and be sad
I have something maybe at 10/11 lol sorry
oh but dinner is at 7
this is the nature of ryan and i's friendship for the past like 15 years or whatever its been
its ok
hahaha
im not that mad
Ah ok üòï
I don't want to make anyone mad
üòï
we just have really different opinions about certain things
It's a little intense lol bc I don't read these things well
honestly its ok
haha sorry
sorry to rant to the group haha
you didnt do anything wrong
and some of them are just after arguing about it for years we've agreed to disagree
Ok
i appreciate the concern :0
haha
:)
and refused to talk to each other for like a year
ryan and i clashed a lot back in hs
i think after that we learned how to bicker without actually straining our friendship
one time we got really mad at each other because our worst qualities rubbed up against each other
Ah
I'm not a fan of conflict lol
yeah me neither
do you want?

what's you doing today
Getting brunch with a friend then BBQ?
But I feel kind of sick üòû so idk if I'm going to stay long or go to karaoke
I want to go meet new people but I do think I'm getting sick
drink gallons of water
noooo
gonna drive down to South bay soon to visit parents and then go to that groomsmen thing
stay strong for the spicy ramen LOL
Haha :P
ooo we said Monday right
Same ish?
Ooh where are we doing Thursday board games
When are we doing that again?
I'll mark on my calendar?
I'll swing by karaoke after I'm.back in sf
What're you doing today?
force yourself to not be sick
Oooh Monday?
we can host at ava
Ok
also spying on Libbey date was actually so fun yesterday
hahaha
lemme update
im curious if the girl had an idea of what we were doing
Did you eat pancakes?
Haha it looked fun
maybe the lady was also a secret friend
nah the lines were crazy
some lady let Libbey and his date cut
maybe everyone there secretly knew him
he also got to skip the line to get in
he'll be even more smooth after he waxes
That seems like a super cute date
ayyyy
Haha so smooth
Do you think they have potential?
hmm I'm not too sure
haha
;)
That's quite the run isn't it?
they still seemed to just be like
he didn't even put his arm around her until like 3 hours later
Have they kissed?
Aw
connie is more hopeful than I am
He must really like her
Ah
it kinda felt like chemistry of a second date
and it was like an awkward
5 dates though
they seemed to have good conversation
but it didn't seem super intimate
arm around sofa thing
but their body language didn't seem super flirty
tryinga get to know each other
not sure
so maybe not
I hope so tho
he seems to like her
Maybe he's just shy to make the first move??
Awww
sounds familiar
ya
jk
it's possible
LOL
LOL
I think I need to stop making first moves all the time
Maybe Jason has too much
I need to learn patience
maybe he has chill
ya maybe he does
I needa learn
tho it's 4th date!
I've had first dates with more touching
LOL my grandpa was like
you got taller
You do seem pretty tall lately
Maybe you did!
LOL
How do you usually make a move?
I seem pretty tall lately
LOL
I take their socks off ;)
LOL.
No really what is your big move
I usually just start by being touchy and stuff
hmm
but eventually just put arm around them and get close
Noice
which is actually kinda hard for me cuz I'm not usually super touchy
What're you bringing to BBQ?
I feel like usually when I do make a move it's not like a huge risk
sometimes I make a joke about it first
sometimes I just go for it
cuz it's usually obvious if the dates going well
and if our faces get really close I'll just kiss her
and I just get closer and closer and stuff
so iunno it's hard for me to date girls who aren't very expressive LOL
I'm not going to BBQ remember
cuz then I can't tell if she wants me to make a move
Right
Ohhh
what are you bringing
other than your cold germs
üòç
Ah idk ><
buy an egg salad or something hahaa
just like iunno
hahaha :P
Haha maybe...
I'm just gonna buy burgers from Costco for my groomsmen bbq
ya it's just the lazy way LOL
she seemed like she just really doesn't understand how to be polite and social nuances
but she's like not very polite or good at like being appreciative and stuff
hahaha a cousin stayed over at my parents place for a while
my parents were complaining about her for a while
but she's 23! how does that happen
Oh like in the Chinese way?
what do you mean?
Oh like there are some things that are traditionally nice to do in Chinese culture
ohh ya
so rude
but she like barely even said thanks apparently
ya partially that
That's bad
Where is she from
Oh yeah.
I don't know her much
cuz she barely talks
every question I ask she just gives a couple word response
Oh. Does she only speak Chinese?
Beijing I think
yaaaa
I don't like chatting with people in Chinese
I don't actually enjoy hanging out with relatives that much because of this
do you have any relatives in America
cuz im less expressive
*no
All in China
Non
it's so frickin hot in south bay
you turned French for a sec there
Ooh that's legit
Haha
Sunny!
how's it in sf
Bonfire is fun but my clothes got so smokey
I love the weather today! :) it's the best part of the week!
then  realized it was me
LOL me too
Haha

Haha sorry

LOL.
Ok spicy noodles tomorrow right?
Idk if we should make like eggs to go with or if I should buy normal ones to eat after lol
yeaaa
Should we video it lol? I feel like it's kind of a momentous occasion
def video
yum
we can just drop a few eggs in
eggs!
Like go Facebook live?
Wait but that's not part of the challenge
Or Snapchat? Idk
Should we film it? Or is that social media overkill
Ahhh idk how we should do it
ive never used that feature
leggo
facebook live!
Haha ok
hows the sick?
Feeling a lot better
I think I still have a little something but it's no biggie now haha
but alcohol kills germs tho
Still probably shouldn't drink in the next few days
haha glad you feel better!
bootie was super fun
too bad you didnt get to come out with us
so fun!
Aww I'm sad I missed our
Is everyone going OOT
ohhh like next weekend?
yeah!
*out
I love bootie!
What is everyone's plan next week btw?
im not too sure i still need to figure out if i actually wanna do jetskiing
cuz robin isnt around and he really wanted to do it
but other than that i think im gonna stay in town
Ah ok
I just have a long ish weekend haha
No plans
what you thinking?
But I was half expecting everyone to be gone :P
hahaha yeah i think a good number of people will still be around
yeah
but i wasnt sure who was going on the trip
Oh ok. I know Aki is planning a Tahoe trip so I wasn't sure
eh iunno if im feeling it
Ah
Are you?
tahoe is kinda cold if im gonna go boating id rather just do it in lake berryessa
which is gonna be 96F
http://www.boredpanda.com/uninspiring-quotes-instagram-unspirational/
Ah
LOL
albert sent this to me just now
Lol your meme sources....
So basic
LOL yes I saw your Facebook day haha
I'm very jealous
:D
the porridge
it was reallly good
About Jenny
lol Jesus Jason. That's kinda mean
did you hear what happened after they broke up
haha
with james
Lol yeah I can tell
eh i really dont like her
No what
complaining about ari
james said ill pay for 2 lapdances
but she got like 5
so jenny and james went to a strip club
and then went around talking to all the dancers about ari
and he did
and then she expected james to pay for all of that
eventually they charged them $400 on top of dances because she wasted the strippers time
Ohh
I think you told me
Man. It's
Why'd he pay
But man it's a fine line before crossing into crazy girl territory.
Lol is it bad I sympathize with her? Not that I think ari did anything wrong...
So easy to see how girls can spiral into this dark thing over guys
I have those impulses too
I mean I get it too
Yeah
but the part that's rude is making James pay for it
she was like oh I'm poor
What was the reasoning there?
I can't believe he paid
and James is unemployment trying to start a companh
even though she just got a tech job
Wth.
Wait why did they go to strip club if she's poor
and thinks that everyone has to treat her to things
she seems to have a superiority complex
ya
that's part of the problem
Yeah :/
I think it's probably a confidence developed out of a defense mechanism
For other insecurities.
ya...
üê´

hey @will, @daniel and i were discussing this last week. Right now a lot of tasks relating to connex in prod has to be handled by infra team. Most of the people on connex team don't have access to production environments nor any experience doing any maintenance work. What's the expectation moving forward?

[12:45]
should we be requesting access to prod machines and begin taking over most of these work? or is the expectation to just reach out to infra's help on these type of tasks moving forward
"These gross engineers"
so gross
at least the cap was closed so it didnt smel

üò¨
so not too sure what the clubs atmosphere is like
last time I went it was too crowded so we hung out downstairs
I've never been at the dance floor at Raven
hi you look bored
and then had no other line after that
just stood there in awkward silence
he walked up and said
and Paulina got hit on by a weird dude
More girls.
Omg yes
ya she's on vacation for a few weeks with serge
Wait is Connie out this weekend?
LOL
ya down
rude is great
Dang
More rude girls
Already?
Let's invite Jacqueline and Robin :)
she's leaving on Wed I think
nah you aren't even that rude
you needa step up your rude game if you wanna hang with the pros
I'm so rude
you have to live it
rude isn't just something you say you are
uhuh sure
be rude back
This.
Fucking,
Guy.
LOL.
ya I can't wait until Seattle installs their first cell tower
don't you hate it when you go to another city and they confiscate your phone at the airport
it's the worst
Yeah. Maybe he forgot to bring a charger.
thats true
Or maybe he went into a coma
yeah prob because you were in a coma
That was the joke lol
pretty likely tbh
I don't remember the first time I went to Seattle
i remember the first time i traveled
üê´
Um it was SO FUNNY
you're right
im laughing too hard rn
LOLOL
well it wasnt very funny
Or do my jokes give you life
no one can tell cuz i laughed so hard that it doesnt make any sound
Are you ded yet
:P jk
by all calculations im prob gonna live forever
your funny jokes kill me
LOL
actually can you keep messaging this kyle
i wanna keep making fun of him
üò¨ soon
Just had my chat at 3...
It felt a lot better
But. Idk if my work load will go down
But knowing my manager is more understanding already lifts a huge burden off my chest
She said she understood and wants to help
what did your manager say?
And that she still wants the op to be there for me if I want it or get better in 3-6 months
thats good
but no concrete changes though it seems
hopefully she didnt just say that to make you feel better
Yeah....but she seemed genuine.
Or I am too trusting of words
just be careful
even if she isn't lying and genuinely want to help it's hard to know if anything would change
but its good that you know you have her understanding now
Yeah. I think the work anxiety was the worst part for me
And a lot of it was alleviated bc I worked a full day on Sunday lol
But I don't want to do that
ya definitely
lol seriously help me craft a response to kyle tonight though
Idk. Something smart
what do you want to say to him?
what message do you want to send to him?
no i dont mean what words do you want to say
If not, something sarcastic and witty
No idea!!!
Something like.
I want to see a cute guy grovel
If you ever want to see me again. I want to see you grovel.
LOL
do you want to date someone you have to guilt into caring about you
No
so you just want to toy with him then
LOL
Or get a really nice free dinner
Oh Man or like
*other plans
"Oops, wasn't sure if you'd died or not, so I already made plans for Friday"
after this season finale, id really rather date someone whom im 100% sure is alive
i like that one
LOL.
i think even if we disregard the fact that he clearly doesnt care that much
?
honestly tho
since you just met once anyway
i think that part is not even a big deal
Yeah. But a grovel would mean a lot to me
but he seems like type of person who just doesnt really communicate that much outside of meetings
Considering all the pain I went through thanks to him
and i dont think you work well with that type of people
i know lotsa people like that
theres nothing wrong with them
but i think you'll just get way more pain if you continue meeting up with him
i feel like he doesnt care enough to
making him grovel will be fun tho
if i went on a date with a girl that i was kinda into and then rarely text her cuz i just forget to sometimes
i doubt theres anything she can say to make me start groveling
if she gets mad id just apologize and cut it off
Yeah
yeah
lol I don't think he will
The only way I can get him to grovel is hurt his pride
but he might just get defensive and yell at you
And make him insecure about his womanizing abilities
ha
And he's too cool
That's too not cool for him
ya
his communication skills are too subpar for a proper fight
Like
thats fair
Man. He's so smooth
he'll get mad but then forget to yell at you for a week
lol nvm
Or too good
chill
down girl
but not in a vindictive sounding way
maybe just act like you totally forgot about friday
dont say things like oh you texted so slow i rescheduled
huh?
oh im busy friday sorry
so you gotta show disinterest
oh i dont mean those exact words
I can't be like "huh?"
i just meant like that idea
LOL.
Lol this isn't IRL
LOL
Hahahaha
dont give him the satisfaction of thinking you were sitting aroudn waiting for the text and is now bitter about it
maybe even apologize
oh im sorry! i have plans already! maybe another time.
Like I thought of this in a minute.
Nah. I want to send something snappy
that doesnt sound like you thought of it in a minute?
I mean. I thought of it in a minute
I like it.
LOL. Sorry. I thought you died so I made other plans for Friday.
Just
LOL. Maybe not the dinner part.
I just want free food from a player.
I'm free for dinner next Tuesday though.
hahaha
do you trust yourself to go to the free food without feeling bad when you doesnt text you again?
.....idk
i wouldnt trust myself
You weak around the boyz too üòâ

ill bring it over on wed
Kk
felby wants a nooodles
LOL.
haha
ugh my current project is kinda frustrating at work
not the project itself but the stuff it touches is kinda annoying
üòû sorry. How come?
it's dealing with this other system that is kinda old and poorly put together
so im just constantly trying to figure out why things arnet working
and sometimes in the middle of figuring one thing out it breaks something else
haha
iunno this isnt that uncommon in engineering though
but i feel like its bothering me more the last few days
üòû that sounds sucky though
Hope you figure it out soon
its kinda dumb but when connie and i were spying on libbeys date
because i think ive been thinking about more things that have been bothering me that ive just been kinda not worrying about
?
while waiting for them we were just chatting about life
Hmm, yeah.
and she was like bascially saying the same thing you said about how to my friends it feels like im never unhappy about anything
and i said well yeah thast true
except said said that she thinks that im just scared to be vulernable
but thast fine i dont need no help
other than like shitting on things for fun or ranting about things that dont matter that much
and shes like yeah not saying that you dont have your shit together but dont want you to just not have anyone to talk to
iunno ive thought a lot more about what upsets me
and i realized that i actually dont tell anyone any of my real problems
and i dont like it
hahaha
üòï yeah.
yeah
And you're there for a lot of us
Nah.
You should always have someone to talk to about things
yeah
but i feel weird saying things
iunno i always want to help
As much as you reach out for other stuff haha
So don't feel like you can't reach out whenever you know?
well not everyone does
And then talk about stuff
Everyone understands if you're just like "had a bad day"
or at least i wouldnt want to
i know there are def a lot of my friends that i cant talk to about
and i got like 2 words in
i htink thats also part of why i got kinda annoyed earlier
well firstly because i hate getting talked over
Yeah sorry üòû
but thats not as big a deal
cuz like ryan kept repeating the same thing
Yeah. His advice was stemming from something totally different
and i felt like
And you're the only one I talk to about it
I think ryan was being a bit aggressive about it bc I wasn't making good life choices lately, but this wasn't supposed to be so intense
So he had no context
hes not being sensative to your actual emotions
if i were to talk to him about my problems
but thats the thing though
and im like man fuck that guy i just wanna punch him in the face
he'll just be like
instead of recognizing why i feel trhat way
like say if someone i know annoyed me
NO ITS NEVER A GOOD IDEA TO PUNCH IN THE FACE
Yeah.
WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THAT
like obvious i dont wanna actually punch him in the face
oh why dont you do this _____ more then you wont have problems anymore!!!
he'll be like
??
always focus on making healthy choices
in spite of emotions
of like ryans ability to just
but i think im also jealous
yeah
study all the time
man if i could do all those things
Me too.
and im jealous and i wish i can just make my life great so easily
Yeah...
go to gym everyday and never eat carbs
go and learn 50 instruments
id be so fit and talented and everything
But the thing is it's nice you're more relatable
yeah
i dont have any negative feelings about him
hes personable and has a lot of talents and knowledge
i think ryan has a much easier time making surface friends than me
You can be more empathetic and compassionate
That's something I think ryan might have a hard time with.
but i dont think im jealous of ryan
Well. I think Ryan's like that bc he has his own inner demons
and every time i go home and visit my parents
they always tell me like
yeah i agree
Yeah I think everyone has those struggles which is why we can all mostly sympathize
I don't think he's all 100% happy like he says
oh just take care of yourself and be healthy if you ever are tired just rest you dont have to try that hard no one needs to be rich or successful as long as you're doing well its ok
but i do wish i had more motivation and self control
and i think ive been subconsciously struggling with that since college
and it actually really annoys me
i want to be inspired to do more not told that its ok
ive gotten way healthier since then but i never really got back the level of energy i had before it all happened
i also had some health issues early on in college
But I think that's just what parents say though. Like at a certain point
They want to know you're safe
and for a long time i was alwasy pretty tired
and i htink im still pretty bitter about all of it
i was a lot more ambitious and motivated before all that
had some pretty severe sleeping issues for quite a while
literally no one but my parents even know about this
because i dont like to think about it
üòï I'm sorry that happened to you
but i do feel a bit robbed
But hey - nothing ever ends up the same as it was in the past.
yeah
If you're being healthier and growing now, it can be better in a different way
whereas before i wanted to be the best
if i actually am filling that time with other meaningful things
and i typically was
my attitude towards life has completely shifted to "be good enough, thats fine"
there isnt
and thats what i tell everyone
I'm sure there are things about you now that you wouldn't trade though
I don't get what's wrong with just being happy.
im ok with not trying that hard
Well if it's a philosophy that everyone always looks down on in favor of being competitive
but a lot of times i feel like im just tired out and dont have the energy to do things
I feel like it's not right
Yeah. I mean I get wanting to be better
Yeah üòû
and i wish i had the energy i had before all the issues
But I think if you want it, you still have it in you.
but honestly one thing im scared of
yeah its possible
or ive just gotten used to feeling tired all the time
and this is just my new normal
is i dont know if ive actually fully gotten over my health issues
if im gonna be lazy, i wanna choose to be lazy
its kinda like a
not be forced because my body is being annoying to me
But I think you recognizing it and what you want is good
Yeah. I think I can relate.
And being tired
To kind of acknowledge the difference I guess between being lazy bc you want to
i joke about it and hide it
yeah
and i brag about certain physical feats im good at because it makes me feel more normal
i joke about being able to drink a lto and not getting sick and stuff because i feel like
at least therse a few things my body can do better than an average person im not totally broken
but honestly those things dont really matter
all it means is i have to spend more money to get buzzed
Aw Jason!
Not my average
LOL
Haha
that soudned reallyh sweet
*not
Don't say that!
im not too sure what it means
You shouldn't look down on average people - but you're definitely my average
but
Weird typo
*NOT average
You have an abnormal positivity that I think attracts a lot of people
Anyway
hahaha
And I can tell you're really smart. And not in the ways that people here circle jerk about it.
yeah for sure
hahaha
You just have to know the strengths you've developed since the time you think back to
and slowly changed
and then i realized i hated how i acted
Haha
i used to be one of those that circle jerk about omg how many algorithms can you solve
I think what trips people up a lot is this concept of self
Yeah. I'm sure you're way better in a lot of aspects now
And a lot of people don't see that their definition is ever evolving. And that sometimes you're not an eevvee anymore so you can't focus on how great your Take-Down was. You are past using Take-Down. You're a jolteon now
You have strengths you developed that you should see as who you are
yeah!
i dont think i would have liked him
i def dont want to be who i was before college
hahaha but i do think that if i never had any health issues then
but what if i wanted to become a flareon
Idk.
Not think that the differences between now and the past are necessarily weaknesses
ok thats a bad analogy
Ofc it's not wrong to think about it. I just hope you have positive things to look forward to as well
No regrets Jason! It will only give you wrinkles :)
true!!
i could be even better now than i am
and it still feels really weird to bring them up
but im glad i talked to you about them
ive never told anyone these things
aww thanks katherine
Of course! Anytime.
Sometimes it's just nice to get things off your chest too
The stress of telling my manager alone helped
Like even though work probably won't get better for me
yeah
thats really nice
aww
Yeah. So at least I hope talking can help you a bit :)
like some people i think dont make me feel better when i talk to
I'm glad :)
i dont think it always helps
that wasnt a jab at ryan
LOL
Yeah not always
LOL
to me
but this helped
i think a lot of guys dont really have too much compassion
Yeah.
hahaha
You'd understand the struggles of talking to boyfriends at times
also a lot of guy relationships dont really have much emotional deepness or whatever
good thing i dont have to deal with that
Haha no worries
Why girls get so frustrated haha
Omg help though
I got myself into a mess
oh no
what happened
Ahhhh noooo
ohh
Like he was typing a third message
LOL
or nah
fuckkkkkk
Ooh he cancelled the third response
ok
cancelled the third response?
But stopped
fuck
Lol
He didn't text me at allll
do you want to meet him again?
Right?
Or want to eat Korean food with meeee
I can't just let him have the upper hand bc he says like 1 or 2 nice words
yeah
this shouldnt have changed anything
Fuck.....
i also want to eat a whole pizza rn
its that he doestn really care that much and dont really text you
i know you do want to meet him again
like the problem wasnt that he wasnt serious
but
LOL
yeah
Yeah.
Fuck.
LOL
I'm laughing so hard right now bc you were so right
but its not a good idea
LOL
Omg
humnans arent robots
and do something unhealthy
i think sometimes its ok to be a lil bad once in a while
Why did I even say that
But what if he will change lol
Hahahaha
but i think saying yes to him now would be a big mistake
But
I'm too gullible
you'll be sad for a long time
we can enjoy oursleves once in a while
this will just feed your addiction
the pizza will actually give me enjoyment
maybe i wont even feel bad tomorrow
If I go to the gym tomorrow morning
but the pizza would taste so good!
Can I meet up with him
the difference is
theres a subtle difference
When did I first go out with this guy
i dont think you should give him reasonings
nooo
Ooh yeah. I'll bring that up.
its just ammo for him to sweet talk you
Like a month ago?
Why
But I want to hear it
haha
What date was that
LOL

Are you sure üòû
if i were in your situation i would not
you never really know right
i mean
and honestly you dont really want to date someone where every time you try to talk or hang out its a big battle
it might be hard now
but its only gonna get harder
LOL ok so
What
story time
some random girl from my hs randomly messaged me and said hey! you are at linkedin right? one of my friends is joining you should hit her up and become friends
so i might stop talking randomly
i guess? sure why not
a few years ago
but ok so
i was like wat
cuz shes just moved to sf and doesnt know anyone
i was at linkedin still
ill tell this asynchronously
so i messaged CK
and we chatted a bit before she joined
so i messaged her friend
lets call her CK
kinda because she just constantly asked me to hang out and stuff and i was like uh sure i guess i have nothing else going on
What is this timeline
she joined like a month after we first chatted
and then later she started we kinda became friends
and like we kinda became friends over like a month or something
Hmm

one day i was gonna hang out with another friend aaron
my team at linkedin had a bunch of people whoere were basically frat bros

I thought she worked at LinkedIn

so i think you misunderstood the point of that story
the point is that you arent her
LOL
you're crazy but not that crazy
and i can tell because im crazy
but shes like EVEN more so
im like super talkative and needy
but not that crazy either
but i bet she was very unhappy throughout that whole relationship
nothing i coulda done woulda made her happy
i get sad if someone doesnt respond within a couple hours
oh
So this isn't relevant to your life anymore?
and the thing is
so i told it
Wait what was this story for lol
oh no it isnt
she gets sad if i dont respond within a few mins
LOL
LOL
and thats not either my nor her fault
Lol
Wait.
you said tell story
thats not true sometimes i can
but she was being weird about it
oh wait
no
Oh
i was down to just be friends
Well.
Thought you were going to intro me to my bff
and you were like tell!
Yes.
Ohhhh
But like are y'all friends now
i wish i had that effect on girls

but like later tho
LOL
but you can't tell anyone
>:(
üò°
if you do that I'll go crazy on you too
üò°
I will publish your bio
I had that happen to me before too so annoying
I wish it would tell me like Google does
Woah wtf. Someone tried to log into my Facebook
sometikes it's random Russian hackers
Who is
ugh changr your password I guess
Wtf twice
LOL jk
sorry about that

sometimes Google tells me like
someone in Siberia tried to access your account
Tell me Jason crazy story
I'm bored at work
tonight!
:( i would but im really busy rn at work
Okkkk
Nah
ok fine
pls sync your busy schedule to mine
What happens when I don't work hard enough at work T____T
what you do
oh no
I'm digging a kyle hole
Help help
Lol
omg
because secretly you wanted him to sweet talk you out of that reason
why did you give a reason
"Not just looking for a hookup"
you wanted to give him an opening
T___________________T
Hahaha I'm so dumbbbbb
But like his wording
nooo
T___________T
ok i know why you gave a reason
Do you think he misworded
I'm like Sansa season 1
but that reason is totally not what your real reason is
so now even if you dont wanna anymore
to be like
wait acutally i lied my real reason is because ____
its gonna be even more awk
Should I just try
I mean. I'm think I can get out
If I want out
But
Idk ><
Idk. I know you and everyone logical and smart will say no
Fuckkkkk
but you met him once
he didn't even want to eat Korean food with you
why do you even like him
Because our first date was like magical üòû
it's not even about logic tho
hes charismatic sure
Yeah üòû but what if he was out with friends
And that's the only context I have of him in person
Ok
Ugh
Yeah
iunno
at least based on the stuff he texted
also I don't like him
I don't want to be friends with him
not only that he's none of the things you said you are looking for
he just charmed you well
he doesn't give you the attention you want
he's not nerdy
doesn't seem to care that much
Can they?
haha
im actually really curious
how smooth he really is now
You're so right
In person
I don't think just anyone smooth can pull that off right?
Alaidjsnsnap
But idk.
I felt like we had super good chemistry
i wanna learn
Idk.
Hahaha
Just
And like nowhere near as
LOL. I know right
Fuckkkk
Why'd he have to text me again
Like I was so stupid happy after our date
what
Idk. Like thrilled?
LOL
Like I obsessed about chris forever
I was so happy.
like
Like how could he care so much and ask such thoughtful questions
i know that feeling
Yeah
"But I've been drank on dates"
*drank on dates
what did he ask?
why is that thoughtful and sweet
lol I've drank on dates
Because no one ever asks that
What did we even talk about
Like about what I was like as a kid idk
Maybe I was drunk.
oh yeah
But I've been drunk on dates
during the date?
hmm
i dont get it
In the way he did
oh
he prob just knew what to ask
but iunno
oh
i think ive had girl ask me that before too
And he just stops and suddenly asks me
It's like out of a fucking romcom
Like we weee talking about smth stupid and shallow or joking
it just happens
Ughhhhhhhhh
rip off the bandaid
Idk
you dont really choose who you fall for
you were in love with the experience
*by
it doesnt always make sense
Fuck I'm like convincing myself my reminiscing
And the way he asked if I though we'd see each other again
But like. It was so fun. Why not again
Idk. I can't look through our old texts but like I remember he texted me at least every other day?
not him
i honestly dont think id like him based off what you showed me from his texts
nah
either way isnt great
Yeah. But maybe he was trying to be cool?
and only showed the texts
like if you never mentioned this date
Idk is that nice?
either hes really good at being fake or hes just like that
pls
Except for these recent few days
i get mad if you spend more than a few hours
I mean chris messages me less
if i was dating him id be so pissed
and messages their SO every few mins
omg
Lol
at least every other day
people dont like
but not that much more
i dont know anyone who like
kath
Yeah but we aren't dating
messages all t heir friends once every other day
like sure most people message htheir SO more than their friends
fucking
Unless they're persistent
Like I set a bad pace?
><
for days at a time
before going oh maybe i should respond to these others
like if you date
sure
open their phone
he'll def message you a bit more
But like maybe it's my fault bc I also text guys like once or twice a day max at first?
and i ngore every single message and only respond to their so every few mins
but not much more
either his sense of humor needs some help
its not your fault that he forgot about you for a weekend
wtf
and that korean food thing
and didnt ask you to anything for 2 weeks
dont date joffrey
id be pissed
Lol
but i dont like his messages
i chill
actually
ya
if some girl was sending me these
No I mean I get it. I was mad at Sansa for season 1-6.9
Ugh
i bet that pumpkin ale i drank that one time isnt even that good
as if he's super amazing
and now you just look back fondly
and also hung up about chris
so it suddenly made you really happy
like
i think you were just really sad
and you had a good date
and then i couldnt ever get it again
hje seems magical
No his date was before chris
yeah exactly
but every time i look back i have the most magical memory
becaus i was really stressed out and kinda annoyed about the whole CK thing
Now I need to know this girls name
and that beer made me feel better
Like. I was no nerves for chris bc of Kyle
Yeah. Like he made me forget about chris
so thats why
oh yeah
LOL
he doesnt even text you
And not for bro reasons hahah omg
What is wrong with me
Like chris lol. We only laugh for bro reasons
bro reasons
i feel like you make self assessments a lot
you like him because of how it feels to like him
And I've noticed lately I laugh a lot easier than I used to
This so hard
I am trying to justify
i dont think you know yourself that well
Ok but like no lie we had good chemistry and he's the only one that made me like genuinely laugh on a date
hes not
what are you talking about
But like what if he is
i think all of thse things you are feeling are fine
the problem isnt that you dont like him
and i feel like a lot of them dont really represent how you actually act
it will be an emotional rollercoaster
it totlaly is ok to feel this way about him
because he'll make you sad
but its just not a good idea
you do
if i was giving this advice to myself
id say go for it
if i was giving this advice to like a younger me i guess
id so go for it
fall in love
you'll never make the mistake again
be sad
Wait no we're not debating relationship yet!
slowly drain your happiness until you question everything about yourself
LOL wait no
I don't want a boyfriend right now
and then once you finally get out
let it impact your relationships and work
LOL
spend every single day depressed
but i dont want you to do that
Dude no!!!!
lol he's someone who actually has chill and texts me every day. His name is Vincent.
Like.
But like
whoa
And it's not kyle and not chris
But like I know I'm just gonna chill being single right now
whos this?
There's this guy. Only one. That I'm considering really.
nice
when did you meet him
Yeah
He was my last date before I deleted all my apps
ignore kyle
Well he's also gone in VA for the next 2 weeks lol
I haven't said anything bc no problems with him
But he texts me every day and keeps wanting to schedule the next date. It's so new lol.
So.
nice!
see where this goes
He responds like almost right away sometimes.
Like last Monday?
why not just
Ugh
And if it was
And if it wasn't - we have mad chemistry lol fuck what am I saying
Great
But idk.
I learned and got played and I have a good story
I kind of want to go out wth kyle again to see if it was a fluke
hahahahaha
iunno what to do about it
i get the feeling
yeah iunno
if you do find out pls tell
what to do when your brain says no and your heart says fuck you brain i do what i want
LOL
Find out?
Lol what
LOL
Only if you have magazines and get to eat
HHaha he doesn't like foot bath?!
Foot bath is best bath tbh

Don't be mad at me.
whyyy
üò°üò°üò°
well why would i be mad
just be careful
>.>.>.>.>.>.>
I will try üò¢ I feel dumb already
ugh
I'll tryyyyy
I laughed about it this morning
Lol jk.
I mean I do feel dumb
just don't get hooked again
that's good
But it's ok. I'm not taking this seriously this time
I've met people where I felt like we just have SO much chemistry
.......><
I think this happens
it should be easy
Ughhhhh
LOL
What happened?
I bet he did enjoy the time but
I feel like when it's actually REALLY good chemistry
it'd be obvious
well they didn't feel so
there shouldn't be all this worrying
And?
Good?
Like opposite
Yeah.
I keep making it seem like I was wasted
it probably wasn't as much chemistry as you thought
I think
or you were just in a really really easy to impress state of mind
*tipsy
I prob wasn't as smooth
Yeah. I was def more drunk than he was
It was like chris and I
ya
either something about the way he talked just really spoke to you
where I meet someone and I'm thinking holy shit we should be married we talk so well
and I feel like the opposite happens too
but I just felt like I was just talking to pass the time
I've gone on dates where I felt like the girl was super impressed
I'm just drunk or feeling lonely or in a good state of mind etc
them
but a lot of time it's not even then
and I remember thinking holy crap she's so much fun I need to be like best buds with her after this
it can happen not in a romantic context too
like when I was at edc I hung out with this one friend/coworker most of the time
and when I got back I was like reminescing about the weekend like it was the most magical time I've ever had
I eas like wait
wat
but then after hanging out with her after I'm back
LOL that reminds me of another time
she's cool and I like being her friend but like
back in hs
this one girl I was friends with
she like didn't like me that much
and it was something about the environment
but we all hung out together some time in similar groups
for a week
we both felt this strange closeness to each other
in the middle of a night hike she told me
I was pretty annoying back then
we both went to be science camp counselors
"I don't know what to do I feel really weird around you but like I have a boyfriend and iunno ughhh"
and I'm like what I thought you found me annoying
I've chased after girls who I thought I had a connection with
then went back to normal LOL
after we went back to school she still kinda felt that for a while
and barely responded and shit
and shE wasn't that interested
wait we don't even have that much chemistry
when I got over her I realozed
I just thought we did because dumb
But I see your point
LOL.
Yeah sorry I was in meetings
The magic I felt might not be felt by him
the magic might not even be because of him
and ascribe it to a person
and also
its possible to fall in love with a feeling
yeah
You know what's dumb
Yeah
I should've switched it
switched it?
what do you mean
hahaha
I fall really hard for personalities
But
is kyle hot
But I got emotionally attached first to kyle üòû
And emotional someone else
instead of
emotional
Yeah.
Like hook up buddy w kyle
And no one else
haha
plsss

LOL
LOL
Apparently
For like a semester in 8th grade. But then I lightened up
did you ever have any embarassing nicknames people gaev you
I was a real bitch for a while
So like Ice queen
i was SUPER snarky back then
*aggro lol
LOL NOT SHARK
some girl i dated for a while called me snark king for a while
snark king
and i toned it down
I'm super Afro.
she loved it
Idk can you tell?
LOL
SHARK KING?
I can get really bitchy and mean. Idk if anyone except calvin knows that side of me here
but then some girl i was chasing after that didnt
HAHAHA
ahahaha
NOT SHARK KING
was your nickname ever illiterate
I think you seem super nice now
LOL
i just gave peopel shit a lot
LOL
Yeah but not snarky
Hahahaha I just realized I misread it
Not you mistyped it
Makes it even better
hahaha
i got a lot less rude
i still love it tho
oh i was never mean
i know you have it in you
Wait do I seem like a bitch though? Like aside from when I was with calvin
Lol but from calvin though right
Bc I wonder if people can tell I have it in me
but now you dont
nah you dont
LOL
ya
In my EYES
it burns just a bit brighter
i cant
because im blinded by my own fire
LOL
Not from like bc you see the FIRE
No way
Whats 4.5
Oh
well I'm not surprised you can't tell miss 4.5
It's -4.5
LOL
LOL
diopters
It's accurate
whoa you spelled pedantic right
Omg it's not pedantic
was your nickname also pedant queen
have you been reading that intro to typing book
So I can't fat finger it
ok like this is the type of snark she nicknamed me for
LOL
That's like just normal banter haha
Ok bye bye have fun at Gogi Time
lol that's not snark
I was never like actually mean
-.-"
lol pedantic doesn't have close letters
chyll
so your snark is
It's like normal jokes
Who would not like that wtf
hey did you die yet?
cuz I really need some good news today
That's just rude
WTF
I was smarter and meaner
And setting your own punch line up is not clever
Like omg I was so mean
LOL
We ended up dating
And I'm a mean arguer
Like super mean
my ex helped me improve a lot
But that was my mean period
Like BITCH
so like not actually funny
gotcha
Yeah not funny
This guy would like try to say stuff. And I would just be like "Will - fucking shut up."
But it definitely went down a bit when I was with calvin
at least you aren't a good arguer
;)
Please. I would dust you.
I mean in your mind maybe
Psh.
so what's your definition of snark
Omg you have a friend name Harvard
Or disappoint their parents forever
cuz your example wasn't it either
Did they go to Harvard
But you get it
Idk. lol that's such a lame example.
Snark is like "Man what if I asked her out though" "It's ok, we all know you never had the balls to."
iunno I'm out of practice
cuz those were just teasing
that's not snark
my examples weren't good either
but you're right
I think my stomach weighs more than you now
I take back what I said about stretching stomach being not possible
Pics
so full
I am
carnage
Boo empty
cuz I ate it alllll

haha
it didn't agree with my stomach
You should invite tiff :3
For tomorrow
highly doubt shed come
I invite her to everything and she shows up like once every few months
ya oh well
also I don't think she clubs
or drinks that much
Aw
err drinks very often*
oooo tacos for dinner today yayy
Omg!!! Yummm
I accidentally sent to group chat
I feel richer :P
Lol my lite coin doubled in value lol
nice!
im scared to put money into coins
!!!
but they are always growing so well
im torn
as part of work
we work with a certain huge bank
(cant say who yet cuz relationship not public yet)
and they just sent me an email saying
looks like you used our API recently, we want to collect some feedback, lets have a chat, will give $200 amazon giftcard
pretty nice
I regret not buying more
I've profited $200 off an $80 investment
It was a gamble lol
Nice
Oooooo
ooo!! nice!!
thats such good gains
id prob have like over 8 figures
hahaha if i did that back then
i was thinking
i wish i was an adult already cuz i would dump all my money into google
i bet it would double
if you put more in it coulda dropped
yeah no point regretting tho
but i do remember when i was in early highschool
it like 1000x
And has ETH
My friend transferred his LTC to BTC
Yeah haha
And didnt want to buy more bc scared haha
I only wanted to spend like $100 though
But it's hard to tell when should we sell
He's pretty happy lol
i also just dont quite agree with coins economy
it's way too speculatory at the moment
yeah
i dont think he goes by harvard though
oh harvard commented on the video thats why you were mentioning him yesterday
Oh lol
Yea
Aww
Hahaha
Why else
so basically an absolute failure to family
LOL
hahahaha
no he went to purdue
he introduced himself as yuanhua his chinese name
That's rough
Oh dang
lets do that
Wanna invite Vanessa tomorrow?
yup!
and felby didnt want people to see the old chats about libbey's girl
so aki added a bunch of people to the previous group
did you have easy time telling people off
LOL
back when you were ice queen
but like if i have to actually tell people
ive been thinking about that
yo you need to shape up etc
like i have an easy time being rude to people as humor
or were you only good at being mean when you werent really serious about it
i feel really bad about it
but i def need to practice that if i wanna become manager
and its so hard to me
i had to do it a couple times when i was tech lead
You can't see chat history
LOL
If you add someone new
No I don't like try to critique people
ahaha
*i avoid giving
I don't like to give people critical/stern life advice because I don't feel qualified
I just am mean when I want to be mean.
and hope people respect you for doing it
;)
so basically only unconstructive criticisms from you
yeah i guess the best way to do it is just to do it
one of the people i worked with was really slow to work
but i felt super bad about it
so i had to tell him to try harder and stuff
LOL
wanna come chill
felbs is here
Oh lol hi

Im wearing flip-flops to work
I'm loving this weather
I sick
ugh :(
like as a hobby
doesn't sound like a very fun hobby
Whyyyyy
Idk.......
so it wasn't allergies?
Idk...
or do you get sick a few times a month
are you still just sick from a few weeks ago
My nose is runny and stuffed and my throat is swollen
I'm at home
Yeah but I just finished work
Sucks
I woke up at 8 to do work
are you resting
or did you go to work
Is supposed to be Chinese
Yeah. I think I'm gonna go buy medicine and eat though
damn that sucks
lol nah its hot out
But Chinese is too far üòû
that's good
I always love zhou
wear your michellin man
I'm going to get American breakfast
ooo
what's your sick food?
Idk really
where is Chinese place you were thinking of
aww
Or thurs
Should we do uber dinner tonight instead
I'm down
are you healthy enough?
actually being sick is the perfect time to visit Uber
nah just me
it's ok if everyone else gets infected
Idk what does that mean
Will I infect all of uber?
What's their dinner
Maybe
the food doesn't taste like anything anyway and now you won't be able to notice
Omg uber dinner sounds so yummy today
yayy
all the vegetables for you
üåΩüç†üçÜüçÖ
Man. Should I go to uber for dinner?
yeah :/
I just want to hang with you guys have have a chill dinner
I want to but I'm scared calvin will be there
Or chris will be there :/
yall can all come to blend if you want
oh yeah you are at home
but the meat lasagna i ate last time from them was really good
hmm
iunno how this compares to uber's on vegetarian side
Blend is too far for me today
like ankush
wear a burqa
to lessen chance of running into people
i can bring my team too
If we have a big enough group
Maybe I can sneak by?
And others
yeah true
Or maybe idk
Like have Aki
we could grab dinner at uber and go to another floor
ill message my old team and see if they are around tonight
so even if you bump into people its not as awk
Omg thank you
ok lets do that
yeah
Yeah
Thank you!!!!
:)
?
if we run into chris jo he might want to join us
only prob is
Oh I don't think he will
If he sees I'm there?
hopefully haha
and come over and hang out
i was just thinking he might see like me from afar or something
ohh ok
Let's walk together lol
Um
Oh
yeah
I'm like most worried about Calvin.
kk
ankush is gonna join us! yay
Also
Yummy
so much meat today LOL
Why did jacq say that abt splitting the check actually
I've only eaten with her once
And probably Robin once
hmm
one sec
and they were just mad at you
maybe she was just defending robin
im not too sure
I like never ate with him except once
i ask him why it matters
Oh. Why though >.>
yeah
But like why did Robin even bring that up
he's brought it up beforehand too like when you werent around
iunno
i actually dont get it
or maybe you were right
every time he brings it up
but
:(
Idk.
its weird cuz
so i dont think its actually about the money
and like i argue against him and he usually eventually goes oh thats true ok
aww
and he doesnt really have a good explanation
Ok but like lol Robin does?
ok i dont think jacq hates you
Anyways just random thought.
It's just weird bc I feel like I've never hung out with them
i dont think she has much of an opinion on you
And they hate me lol
she*
and i was like wait what?
Lol man.
who said that
like the first time he asked me about you
she was like
and she said iunno i just thought you didnt
wait i thought yall dont like her?
i think i know about robin
Oh
so thats probably where he got it from
beginning of htis year
not just like a little bit
But like - I've hung out with Robin after
robin was complaining about how you and calvin just argued the whole trip
Ok that's fair
Yeah I mean. I get it.
Idk.
and he hasnt fully 180'd his opinion of you yet
like after our pismo trip that one time
he like complained about it a lot
It just sucks if I ever wanted to be friends with Jacqueline lol
Mk that's fair
she was prob just supporting robin that night
yeah
Yeah but like pretty sure I can't now
cuz like first impressions die hard sometimes
i dont think she dislikes you
whereas i knew you from before and knew you arent always like that
Yeah I guess
you havent really hung out with robin closely since that trip
so from his impression that was the strongest impression he had of you
i think like
Idk. I think it's fine.
I just thought that one thing was a bit unfair
i dont think he hates you
but that was pretty rude
I mean, Robin hung out with Ryan and I when we went to Polk
thats so rude
while you were there
üòï
Oh
Sorry
robin and jacq were being pretty rude
i was kinda mad actually
i was pretty mad at them for doing that
but robin was too far
oh no i meant
i kinda yelled at jacq and she stopped
I guess it's fine.
cuz they were basically just shit talking you to all their friends
oh you didnt hear it?
Oh...no
Oh I didn't realize they were talking badly about me while I was still there
yeah i was pretty drunk and dont remember the details
they werent being loud about ot ir anything but it was just like an active convo
Yeah. Idk.
actually wait...
Ah.
iunno
Because thats pretty mean lol
i dont quite remember if you were still there or not
Was I supposed to?
maybe its after you left
but i just remmeber it being kinda rude and i was kinda mad about it
No I was just really drunk
oh man i thought you heard them and was just sitting there
It's fine. If they're not really into hanging out it's ok. We all hang out in a big group anyway
But I think one on one is fine
oh he is
But I didn't know they were saying those things so much
he complains about everything
robin just likes complaining
i know cuz we complain about ryan to each other
LOL
and ryan and i complain about robin to each other too
It's just weird to me bc Robin seems super friendly
im sure he complains about me to ryan too
I think always being negative about a person in a group setting is kind of gossip/shit talking isn't it?
he doesnt complain about you that much more than he complains about other people
Other people we hang out with?
yeah
oh he doesnt always target you
Like Robin has never talked to me
but we usually like bring it up to them after we finish complaining
so they can improve
yeah
Yeah.
he def shit talks ari a lot
prob the most out of all of us
but like
iunno usually i dont think hes being mean about it
Mm ok
its just his like way of letting out his frustrations
Oh
üòï
hes frustrated about something or someone
i havent seen him do that like in public with a bunch of friends before
normally its like
and vent to me about it
So that's ok!
i just feel like that night was uncharacteristic
I see
maybe he was just drunk
And they were just trying to protect you :)
It's ok. It's probably bc I was being a bad friend
i think thats what jacq was doing
aww
Don't most people?
if we do wine night with a small group jacq might be down to join
Re:uber dinner
lol I have plans tomorrow
Ohhhh
lol
I didn't say tomorrow :P
hahaha I just mean in general I was thinking of opportunities for you meet her again haha
cuz she doesn't usually come to events unless Robin plans them
or if it's like a small thing with just a few of us
Lol haha are you sure it's a good idea?
yes
I don't mind
y'all are my closest friends I don't want there to be animosity
I want y'all to like each other!
yay so they need to like you too
lol I like her! Haha
There's nothing from my end
I like her and I like Robin lol
hahaha
Mk ><

Yeah sure!
